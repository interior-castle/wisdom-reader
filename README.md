# Wisdom Reader

Read the books of Psalms, Proverbs, and Sirach in 60 days.

The text is taken from the World English Bible, updated Catholic edition, which is in the public domain.

This reader was created with the assistance of ChatGPT â€” in fact, I decided to work on this project in part as an experiment to see how well the AI could handle it. I used the AI to develop a reading schedule that would cover these three books in 60 days, with readings of roughly the same length each day. Some manual tinkering with the reading schedule was required, but ChatGPT did most of the work. I then had the AI acquire the text from the Internet and assemble the reader in HTML format (experiments with ebook formats did not go well). After much back and forth and revision, I felt the file was good enough to make into an ebook. Some additional revisions with the AI were necessary to get the text looking good on a Kindle.

I am happy with how this project turned out, and I hope you find this small book useful. Below is a table showing the schedule of readings:
