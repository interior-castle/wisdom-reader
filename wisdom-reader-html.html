  <h2>Day 1</h2>
  
  <!-- Psalms 1, 2, 3 -->
  <h3>Psalms</h3>
  
  <h4>Psalm 1</h4>
  <p>
    1 Blessed is the man who doesn’t walk in the counsel of the wicked,<br>
    nor stand on the path of sinners,<br>
    nor sit in the seat of scoffers;<br>
    2 but his delight is in the Lord’s law.<br>
    On his law he meditates day and night.<br>
    3 He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water,<br>
    that produces its fruit in its season,<br>
    whose leaf also does not wither.<br>
    Whatever he does shall prosper.<br>
    4 The wicked are not so,<br>
    but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.<br>
    5 Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment,<br>
    nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.<br>
    6 For the Lord knows the way of the righteous,<br>
    but the way of the wicked shall perish.
  </p>

  <h4>Psalm 2</h4>
  <p>
    1 Why do the nations rage<br>
    and the peoples plot a vain thing?<br>
    2 The kings of the earth take a stand,<br>
    and the rulers take counsel together,<br>
    against the Lord and against his Anointed, saying,<br>
    3 “Let’s break their bonds apart<br>
    and cast away their cords from us.”<br>
    4 He who sits in the heavens will laugh.<br>
    The Lord will have them in derision.<br>
    5 Then he will speak to them in his anger<br>
    and terrify them in his wrath:<br>
    6 “Yet I have set my King on my holy hill of Zion.”<br>
    7 I will tell of the decree.<br>
    The Lord said to me, “You are my son.<br>
    Today I have become your father.<br>
    8 Ask of me, and I will give the nations for your inheritance,<br>
    the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.<br>
    9 You shall break them with a rod of iron.<br>
    You shall dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.”<br>
    10 Now therefore be wise, you kings.<br>
    Be instructed, you judges of the earth.<br>
    11 Serve the Lord with fear<br>
    and rejoice with trembling.<br>
    12 Give sincere homage to the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish on the way,<br>
    for his wrath may soon be kindled.<br>
    Blessed are all those who take refuge in him.
  </p>

  <h4>Psalm 3</h4>
  <p>
    1 Lord, how my adversaries have increased!<br>
    Many are those who rise up against me.<br>
    2 Many there are who say of my soul,<br>
    “There is no help for him in God.”<br>
    Selah.<br>
    3 But you, Lord, are a shield around me,<br>
    my glory, and the one who lifts up my head.<br>
    4 I cry to the Lord with my voice,<br>
    and he answers me from his holy hill.<br>
    Selah.<br>
    5 I laid myself down and slept.<br>
    I awakened, for the Lord sustains me.<br>
    6 I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people<br>
    who have set themselves against me on every side.<br>
    7 Arise, Lord!<br>
    Save me, my God!<br>
    For you have struck all of my enemies on the cheek bone.<br>
    You have broken the teeth of the wicked.<br>
    8 Salvation belongs to the Lord.<br>
    Your blessing be on your people.<br>
    Selah.

  <!-- Proverbs 1:1–19 -->
  <h3>Proverbs</h3>
  <h4>Proverbs 1:1–19</h4>
  <p>
    1 The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel:<br>
    2 to know wisdom and instruction,<br>
    to discern the words of understanding,<br>
    3 to receive instruction in wise dealing,<br>
    in righteousness, justice, and equity,<br>
    4 to give prudence to the simple,<br>
    knowledge and discretion to the young man—<br>
    5 that the wise man may hear and increase in learning,<br>
    that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsel,<br>
    6 to understand a proverb and parables,<br>
    the words and riddles of the wise.<br>
    7 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge,<br>
    but fools despise wisdom and instruction.<br>
    8 My son, listen to your father’s instruction,<br>
    and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching,<br>
    9 for they will be a garland to grace your head<br>
    and chains around your neck.<br>
    10 My son, if sinners entice you,<br>
    don’t consent.<br>
    11 If they say, “Come with us.<br>
    Let’s lie in wait for blood.<br>
    Let’s lurk secretly for the innocent without cause.<br>
    12 Let’s swallow them up alive like Sheol,<br>
    and whole, like those who go down into the pit.<br>
    13 We’ll find all valuable wealth.<br>
    We’ll fill our houses with plunder.<br>
    14 You shall cast your lot among us.<br>
    We’ll all have one purse.”<br>
    15 My son, don’t walk on the path with them.<br>
    Keep your foot from their path,<br>
    16 for their feet run to evil,<br>
    and they hurry to shed blood.<br>
    17 For the net is spread in vain in the sight of any bird;<br>
    18 but these lay in wait for their own blood.<br>
    They lurk secretly for their own lives.<br>
    19 So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain.<br>
    It takes away the life of its owners.

  <!-- Sirach 1 -->
  <h3>Sirach</h3>
  <h4>Sirach 1</h4>
  <p>
    1 All wisdom comes from the Lord<br>
    and is with him forever.<br>
    2 Who can count the sand of the seas,<br>
    the drops of rain, and the days of eternity?<br>
    3 Who will search out the height of heaven,<br>
    the breadth of the earth, the deep, or wisdom?<br>
    4 Wisdom has been created before all things,<br>
    and the understanding of prudence from everlasting.<br>
    5 The word of God Most High is the fountain of wisdom,<br>
    and her ways are everlasting commandments.<br>
    6 To whom has the root of wisdom been revealed?<br>
    Who has known her shrewd counsels?<br>
    7 To whom has the knowledge of wisdom been manifested?<br>
    Who has understood her great experience?<br>
    8 There is one who is wise, greatly to be feared,<br>
    sitting upon his throne: the Lord.<br>
    9 He created her, saw and measured her,<br>
    and poured her out upon all his works.<br>
    10 She is with all flesh according to his gift;<br>
    he has given her freely to those who love him.<br>
    11 The fear of the Lord is glory, exultation,<br>
    and gladness, and a crown of rejoicing.<br>
    12 The fear of the Lord will delight the heart,<br>
    and will give gladness, joy, and length of days.<br>
    13 Whoever fears the Lord, it will go well with him at the last.<br>
    He will be blessed in the day of his death.<br>
    14 To fear the Lord is the beginning of wisdom;<br>
    it was created together with the faithful in the womb.<br>
    15 She laid an eternal foundation with mankind,<br>
    and she will be trusted among their offspring.<br>
    16 To fear the Lord is the fullness of wisdom,<br>
    and she intoxicates men with her fruits.<br>
    17 She will fill all their house with desirable things,<br>
    and her storehouses with her increase.<br>
    18 The fear of the Lord is the crown of wisdom,<br>
    making peace and perfect health to flourish.<br>
    19 He saw and measured her,<br>
    rained down skill and knowledge of understanding,<br>
    and exalted the honor of those who hold her fast.<br>
    20 The root of wisdom is to fear the Lord.<br>
    Its branches are length of days.<br>
    21 Unjust wrath can never be justified,<br>
    for a man’s wrath tips the scale to his ruin.<br>
    22 A patient man will wait for a season,<br>
    and afterward joy will spring up to him.<br>
    23 He will hide his words until the right moment,<br>
    and the lips of many will proclaim his understanding.<br>
    24 The parables of knowledge are in the treasures of wisdom,<br>
    but godliness is an abomination to a sinner.<br>
    25 If you desire wisdom, keep the commandments,<br>
    and the Lord will grant her to you freely;<br>
    26 for the fear of the Lord is wisdom and instruction.<br>
    Faith and humility are his good pleasure.<br>
    27 Don’t disobey the fear of the Lord.<br>
    Don’t come to him with a divided heart.<br>
    28 Don’t be a hypocrite in the mouths of men.<br>
    Keep watch over your lips.<br>
    29 Don’t exalt yourself, lest you fall<br>
    and bring dishonor upon your soul.<br>
    The Lord will reveal your secrets<br>
    and will cast you down in the midst of the congregation,<br>
    because you didn’t come in the fear of the Lord,<br>
    and your heart was full of deceit.

  <h2>Day 2</h2>
  
  <!-- Psalms 4, 5, 6 -->
  <h3>Psalms</h3>

  <h4>Psalm 4</h4>
  <p>
    1 Answer me when I call, God of my righteousness!<br>
    Give me relief from my distress.<br>
    Have mercy on me, and hear my prayer.<br>
    2 You sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor?<br>
    Will you love vanity and seek after falsehood?<br>
    Selah.<br>
    3 But know that the Lord has set apart for himself<br>
    him who is godly.<br>
    The Lord will hear when I call to him.<br>
    4 Stand in awe, and don’t sin.<br>
    Search your own heart on your bed, and be still.<br>
    Selah.<br>
    5 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness.<br>
    Put your trust in the Lord.<br>
    6 Many say, “Who will show us any good?”<br>
    Lord, let the light of your face shine on us.<br>
    7 You have put gladness in my heart,<br>
    more than when their grain and their new wine are increased.<br>
    8 In peace I will both lay myself down and sleep,<br>
    for you alone, Lord, make me live in safety.
  </p>

  <h4>Psalm 5</h4>
  <p>
    1 Give ear to my words, Lord.<br>
    Consider my meditation.<br>
    2 Listen to the voice of my cry, my King and my God;<br>
    for I pray to you.<br>
    3 In the morning, Lord, you will hear my voice.<br>
    In the morning I will lay my requests before you, and will watch expectantly.<br>
    4 For you are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness.<br>
    Evil can’t live with you.<br>
    5 The arrogant will not stand in your sight.<br>
    You hate all workers of iniquity.<br>
    6 You will destroy those who speak lies.<br>
    The Lord abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.<br>
    7 But as for me, in the abundance of your loving kindness I will come into your house.<br>
    I will bow toward your holy temple in reverence of you.<br>
    8 Lead me, Lord, in your righteousness because of my enemies.<br>
    Make your way straight before my face.<br>
    9 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth.<br>
    Their inward part is destruction.<br>
    Their throat is an open tomb.<br>
    They flatter with their tongue.<br>
    10 Hold them guilty, God.<br>
    Let them fall by their own counsels.<br>
    Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions,<br>
    for they have rebelled against you.<br>
    11 But let all those who take refuge in you rejoice.<br>
    Let them always shout for joy, because you defend them.<br>
    Let them also who love your name be joyful in you.<br>
    12 For you will bless the righteous.<br>
    Lord, you will surround him with favor like a shield.
  </p>

  <h4>Psalm 6</h4>
  <p>
    1 Lord, don’t rebuke me in your anger,<br>
    neither discipline me in your wrath.<br>
    2 Have mercy on me, Lord, for I am faint.<br>
    Lord, heal me, for my bones are troubled.<br>
    3 My soul is also in great anguish.<br>
    But you, Lord—how long?<br>
    4 Return, Lord. Deliver my soul,<br>
    and save me for your loving kindness’ sake.<br>
    5 For in death there is no memory of you.<br>
    In Sheol, who shall give you thanks?<br>
    6 I am weary with my groaning.<br>
    Every night I flood my bed.<br>
    I drench my couch with my tears.<br>
    7 My eye wastes away because of grief;<br>
    it grows old because of all my adversaries.<br>
    8 Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity,<br>
    for the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping.<br>
    9 The Lord has heard my supplication.<br>
    The Lord accepts my prayer.<br>
    10 May all my enemies be ashamed and dismayed.<br>
    They shall turn back, they shall be disgraced suddenly.
  </p>

  <!-- Proverbs 1:20–33 -->
  <h3>Proverbs</h3>
  <h4>Proverbs 1:20–33</h4>
  <p>
    20 Wisdom calls aloud in the street.<br>
    She utters her voice in the public squares.<br>
    21 She calls at the head of noisy places.<br>
    At the entrance of the city gates, she utters her words:<br>
    22 “How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity?<br>
    How long will mockers delight themselves in mockery,<br>
    and fools hate knowledge?<br>
    23 Turn at my reproof.<br>
    Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you.<br>
    I will make known my words to you.<br>
    24 Because I have called, and you have refused;<br>
    I have stretched out my hand, and no one has paid attention;<br>
    25 but you have ignored all my counsel,<br>
    and wanted none of my reproof;<br>
    26 I also will laugh at your disaster.<br>
    I will mock when calamity overtakes you,<br>
    27 when calamity overtakes you like a storm,<br>
    when your disaster comes on like a whirlwind,<br>
    when distress and anguish come on you.<br>
    28 Then they will call on me, but I will not answer.<br>
    They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me,<br>
    29 because they hated knowledge,<br>
    and didn’t choose the fear of the Lord.<br>
    30 They wanted none of my counsel.<br>
    They despised all my reproof.<br>
    31 Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way,<br>
    and be filled with their own schemes.<br>
    32 For the backsliding of the simple will kill them.<br>
    The careless ease of fools will destroy them.<br>
    33 But whoever listens to me will dwell securely,<br>
    and will be at ease, without fear of harm.”
  </p>

  <!-- Sirach 2 -->
  <h3>Sirach</h3>
  <h4>Sirach 2</h4>
  <p>
    1 My son, if you come to serve the Lord,<br>
    prepare your soul for temptation.<br>
    2 Set your heart aright, and constantly endure.<br>
    Make not haste in time of calamity.<br>
    3 Cling to him, and don’t depart,<br>
    that you may be increased at your latter end.<br>
    4 Accept whatever is brought upon you,<br>
    and be patient when you suffer humiliation.<br>
    5 For gold is tried in the fire,<br>
    and acceptable men in the furnace of humiliation.<br>
    6 Put your trust in him, and he will help you.<br>
    Make your ways straight, and set your hope on him.<br>
    7 You who fear the Lord, wait for his mercy.<br>
    Don’t turn aside, lest you fall.<br>
    8 You who fear the Lord, believe him,<br>
    and your reward will not fail.<br>
    9 You who fear the Lord, hope for good<br>
    and for everlasting joy and mercy.<br>
    10 Look at the generations of old, and see:<br>
    Who ever trusted in the Lord, and was disappointed?<br>
    Or who remained in his fear, and was forsaken?<br>
    Or who called upon him, and he despised him?<br>
    11 For the Lord is full of compassion and mercy.<br>
    He forgives sins and saves in time of affliction.<br>
    12 Woe to fearful hearts, and faint hands,<br>
    and to the sinner who goes two ways!<br>
    13 Woe to the faint heart! For it doesn’t believe.<br>
    Therefore it won’t be defended.<br>
    14 Woe to you who have lost your patience!<br>
    And what will you do when the Lord visits you?<br>
    15 Those who fear the Lord will not disobey his words.<br>
    Those who love him will keep his ways.<br>
    16 Those who fear the Lord will seek his good pleasure.<br>
    Those who love him will be filled with the law.<br>
    17 Those who fear the Lord will prepare their hearts,<br>
    and will humble their souls before him.<br>
    18 We will fall into the hands of the Lord,<br>
    and not into the hands of men;<br>
    for as his majesty is,<br>
    so also is his mercy.

  <!-- Psalms 7, 8, 9 -->
  <h3>Psalms</h3>

  <h4>Psalm 7</h4>
  <p>
    1 Lord my God, I take refuge in you.<br>
    Save me from all those who pursue me, and deliver me,<br>
    2 lest they tear apart my soul like a lion,<br>
    ripping it in pieces, while there is no one to deliver.<br>
    3 Lord my God, if I have done this,<br>
    if there is iniquity in my hands,<br>
    4 if I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me<br>
    (yet I have delivered him who without cause was my adversary),<br>
    5 let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it;<br>
    yes, let him tread my life down to the earth,<br>
    and lay my glory in the dust.<br>
    Selah.<br>
    6 Arise, Lord, in your anger.<br>
    Lift up yourself against the rage of my adversaries.<br>
    Awake for me. You have commanded judgment.<br>
    7 Let the congregation of the peoples surround you.<br>
    Rule over them on high.<br>
    8 The Lord administers judgment to the peoples.<br>
    Judge me, Lord, according to my righteousness,<br>
    and to my integrity that is in me.<br>
    9 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end,<br>
    but establish the righteous;<br>
    their minds and hearts are searched by the righteous God.<br>
    10 My shield is with God,<br>
    who saves the upright in heart.<br>
    11 God is a righteous judge,<br>
    yes, a God who has indignation every day.<br>
    12 If a man doesn’t repent, he will sharpen his sword;<br>
    he has bent and strung his bow.<br>
    13 He has also prepared for himself the instruments of death.<br>
    He makes ready his flaming arrows.<br>
    14 Behold, he travails with iniquity.<br>
    Yes, he has conceived mischief,<br>
    and brought out falsehood.<br>
    15 He has dug a hole,<br>
    and has fallen into the pit which he made.<br>
    16 The trouble he causes shall return to his own head.<br>
    His violence shall come down on the crown of his own head.<br>
    17 I will give thanks to the Lord according to his righteousness,<br>
    and will sing praise to the name of the Lord Most High.

  <h4>Psalm 8</h4>
  <p>
    1 Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!<br>
    You have set your glory above the heavens!<br>
    2 From the lips of babes and infants you have established strength,<br>
    because of your adversaries, that you might silence the enemy and the avenger.<br>
    3 When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers,<br>
    the moon and the stars, which you have ordained;<br>
    4 what is man, that you think of him?<br>
    What is the son of man, that you care for him?<br>
    5 For you have made him a little lower than the angels,<br>
    and crowned him with glory and honor.<br>
    6 You make him ruler over the works of your hands.<br>
    You have put all things under his feet:<br>
    7 All sheep and cattle,<br>
    yes, and the animals of the field,<br>
    8 the birds of the sky, the fish of the sea,<br>
    and whatever passes through the paths of the seas.<br>
    9 Lord, our Lord,<br>
    how majestic is your name in all the earth!
  </p>

  <h4>Psalm 9</h4>
  <p>
    1 I will give thanks to the Lord with my whole heart.<br>
    I will tell of all your marvelous works.<br>
    2 I will be glad and rejoice in you.<br>
    I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.<br>
    3 When my enemies turn back,<br>
    they stumble and perish in your presence.<br>
    4 For you have maintained my just cause.<br>
    You sit on the throne judging righteously.<br>
    5 You have rebuked the nations.<br>
    You have destroyed the wicked.<br>
    You have blotted out their name forever and ever.<br>
    6 The enemy is overtaken by endless ruin.<br>
    The very memory of the cities which you have overthrown has perished.<br>
    7 But the Lord reigns forever.<br>
    He has prepared his throne for judgment.<br>
    8 He will judge the world in righteousness.<br>
    He will administer judgment to the peoples in uprightness.<br>
    9 The Lord will also be a high tower for the oppressed,<br>
    a high tower in times of trouble.<br>
    10 Those who know your name will put their trust in you,<br>
    for you, Lord, have not forsaken those who seek you.<br>
    11 Sing praises to the Lord, who dwells in Zion,<br>
    and declare among the people what he has done.<br>
    12 For he who avenges blood remembers them.<br>
    He doesn’t forget the cry of the afflicted.<br>
    13 Have mercy on me, Lord.<br>
    See my affliction by those who hate me,<br>
    and lift me up from the gates of death,<br>
    14 that I may show all of your praise.<br>
    I will rejoice in your salvation in the gates of the daughter of Zion.<br>
    15 The nations have sunk down in the pit that they made.<br>
    In the net which they hid, their own foot is taken.<br>
    16 The Lord has made himself known. He has executed judgment.<br>
    The wicked is snared by the work of his own hands.<br>
    Meditation. Selah.<br>
    17 The wicked shall be turned back to Sheol,<br>
    even all the nations that forget God.<br>
    18 For the needy shall not always be forgotten,<br>
    nor the hope of the poor perish forever.<br>
    19 Arise, Lord! Don’t let man prevail.<br>
    Let the nations be judged in your sight.<br>
    20 Put them in fear, Lord.<br>
    Let the nations know that they are only men.<br>
    Selah.

    to walk in the ways of darkness,<br>
    14 who rejoice to do evil,<br>
    and delight in the perverseness of evil,<br>
    15 who are crooked in their ways,<br>
    and wayward in their paths,<br>
    16 to deliver you from the strange woman,<br>
    even from the foreigner who flatters with her words,<br>
    17 who forsakes the friend of her youth,<br>
    and forgets the covenant of her God;<br>
    18 for her house leads down to death,<br>
    her paths to the departed spirits.<br>
    19 None who go to her return again,<br>
    nor do they attain to the paths of life.<br>
    20 Therefore walk in the way of good men,<br>
    and keep the paths of the righteous.<br>
    21 For the upright will dwell in the land.<br>
    The perfect will remain in it.<br>
    22 But the wicked will be cut off from the land.<br>
    The treacherous will be rooted out of it.

  <h4>Sirach 3</h4>
  <p>
    1 Hear me your father, O children,<br>
    and do thereafter, that you may be saved.<br>
    2 For the Lord has given the father glory concerning the children,<br>
    and has confirmed the judgment of the mother over the sons.<br>
    3 He who honors his father makes atonement for sins.<br>
    4 He who gives glory to his mother is as one who lays up treasure.<br>
    5 Whoever honors his father will have joy in his own children.<br>
    He will be heard in the day of his prayer.<br>
    6 He who gives glory to his father will have length of days.<br>
    He who listens to the Lord will bring rest to his mother,<br>
    7 and will serve his parents as to masters.<br>
    8 Honor your father in deed and word,<br>
    that a blessing may come on you from him.<br>
    9 For the blessing of the father establishes the houses of children,<br>
    but the curse of the mother roots out the foundations.<br>
    10 Don’t glorify yourself in the dishonor of your father,<br>
    for your father’s dishonor is no glory to you.<br>
    11 For the glory of a man is from the honor of his father,<br>
    and a mother in dishonor is a reproach to the children.<br>
    12 My son, help your father in his old age,<br>
    and don’t grieve him as long as he lives.<br>
    13 If his understanding fails, have patience with him,<br>
    and don’t dishonor him in your full strength.<br>
    14 For the relieving of your father will not be forgotten.<br>
    Instead of sins it will be added to build you up.<br>
    15 In the day of your affliction it will remember you.<br>
    Your sins also will melt away like frost in sunny weather.<br>
    16 He who forsakes his father is as a blasphemer.<br>
    He who provokes his mother is cursed by the Lord.<br>
    17 My son, go on with your business in humility;<br>
    so you will be loved by an acceptable man.<br>
    18 The greater you are, the more humble yourself,<br>
    and you will find favor before the Lord.<br>
    19 Many are in high places, and of renown,<br>
    but mysteries are revealed to the humble.<br>
    20 For the power of the Lord is great,<br>
    and he is glorified by those who are lowly.<br>
    21 Don’t seek things that are too hard for you,<br>
    and don’t search out things that are above your strength.<br>
    22 Think about the things that have been commanded you,<br>
    for you have no need of the things that are secret.<br>
    23 Don’t be overly busy in things that are beyond you,<br>
    for more things are shown to you than men can understand.<br>
    24 For the conceit of many has led them astray.<br>
    Evil opinion has caused their judgment to slip.<br>
    25 A stubborn heart will fare badly at the end.<br>
    He who loves danger will perish in it.<br>
    26 A stubborn heart will be loaded with troubles.<br>
    The sinner will heap sin on sin.<br>
    27 The calamity of the proud has no healing,<br>
    for a weed of wickedness has taken root in him.<br>
    28 The heart of the prudent will understand a parable.<br>
    A wise man desires the ear of a listener.<br>
    29 Water will quench a flaming fire,<br>
    and giving alms will make atonement for sins.<br>
    30 He who repays good turns is mindful of that which comes afterward.<br>
    In the time of his falling he will find a support.

  <h2>Day 4</h2>
  
  <!-- Psalms 10, 11, 12, 13 -->
  <h3>Psalms</h3>

  <h4>Psalm 10</h4>
  <p>
    1 Why do you stand far off, Lord?<br>
    Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?<br>
    2 In arrogance, the wicked hunt down the weak.<br>
    They are caught in the schemes that they devise.<br>
    3 For the wicked boasts of his heart’s cravings.<br>
    He blesses the greedy and condemns the Lord.<br>
    4 The wicked, in the pride of his face, has no room in his thoughts for God.<br>
    5 His ways are prosperous at all times.<br>
    He is haughty, and your laws are far from his sight.<br>
    As for all his adversaries, he sneers at them.<br>
    6 He says in his heart, “I shall not be shaken.<br>
    For generations I shall have no trouble.”<br>
    7 His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and oppression.<br>
    Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.<br>
    8 He lies in wait near the villages.<br>
    From ambushes, he murders the innocent.<br>
    His eyes are secretly set against the helpless.<br>
    9 He lurks in secret as a lion in his ambush.<br>
    He lies in wait to catch the helpless.<br>
    He catches the helpless when he draws him in his net.<br>
    10 The helpless are crushed. They collapse.<br>
    They fall under his strength.<br>
    11 He says in his heart, “God has forgotten.<br>
    He hides his face. He will never see it.”<br>
    12 Arise, Lord! God, lift up your hand!<br>
    Don’t forget the helpless.<br>
    13 Why does the wicked person condemn God,<br>
    and say in his heart, “God won’t call me into account?”<br>
    14 But you do see trouble and grief.<br>
    You consider it to take it into your hand.<br>
    You help the victim and the fatherless.<br>
    15 Break the arm of the wicked.<br>
    As for the evil man, seek out his wickedness until you find none.<br>
    16 The Lord is King forever and ever!<br>
    The nations will perish out of his land.<br>
    17 Lord, you have heard the desire of the humble.<br>
    You will prepare their heart. You will cause your ear to hear,<br>
    18 to judge the fatherless and the oppressed,<br>
    that man who is of the earth may terrify no more.
  </p>

  <h4>Psalm 11</h4>
  <p>
    1 In the Lord I take refuge.<br>
    How can you say to my soul, “Flee as a bird to your mountain!”?<br>
    2 For behold, the wicked bend their bows.<br>
    They set their arrows on the strings,<br>
    that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.<br>
    3 If the foundations are destroyed,<br>
    what can the righteous do?<br>
    4 The Lord is in his holy temple.<br>
    The Lord is on his throne in heaven.<br>
    His eyes observe. His eyes examine the children of men.<br>
    5 The Lord examines the righteous,<br>
    but his soul hates the wicked and him who loves violence.<br>
    6 On the wicked he will rain blazing coals;<br>
    fire, sulfur, and scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.<br>
    7 For the Lord is righteous. He loves righteousness.<br>
    The upright shall see his face.
  </p>

  <h4>Psalm 12</h4>
  <p>
    1 Help, Lord; for the godly man ceases.<br>
    For the faithful fail from among the children of men.<br>
    2 Everyone lies to his neighbor.<br>
    They speak with flattering lips, and with a double heart.<br>
    3 May the Lord cut off all flattering lips,<br>
    and the tongue that boasts,<br>
    4 who have said, “With our tongue we will prevail.<br>
    Our lips are our own. Who is lord over us?”<br>
    5 “Because of the oppression of the weak and because of the groaning of the needy,<br>
    I will now arise,” says the Lord.<br>
    “I will set him in safety from those who malign him.”<br>
    6 The Lord’s words are flawless words,<br>
    as silver refined in a clay furnace, purified seven times.<br>
    7 You will keep them, Lord.<br>
    You will preserve them from this generation forever.<br>
    8 The wicked walk on every side,<br>
    when what is vile is exalted among the sons of men.
  </p>

  <h4>Psalm 13</h4>
  <p>
    1 How long, Lord? Will you forget me forever?<br>
    How long will you hide your face from me?<br>
    2 How long shall I take counsel in my soul,<br>
    having sorrow in my heart every day?<br>
    How long shall my enemy triumph over me?<br>
    3 Behold, and answer me, Lord, my God.<br>
    Give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death;<br>
    4 lest my enemy say, “I have prevailed against him;”<br>
    lest my adversaries rejoice when I fall.<br>
    5 But I trust in your loving kindness.<br>
    My heart rejoices in your salvation.<br>
    6 I will sing to the Lord,<br>
    because he has been good to me.

  <h4>Proverbs 3:1–18</h4>
  <p>
    1 My son, don’t forget my teaching;<br>
    but let your heart keep my commandments,<br>
    2 for they will add to you length of days,<br>
    years of life, and peace.<br>
    3 Don’t let mercy and truth forsake you.<br>
    Bind them around your neck.<br>
    Write them on the tablet of your heart.<br>
    4 So you will find favor,<br>
    and good understanding in the sight of God and man.<br>
    5 Trust in the Lord with all your heart,<br>
    and don’t lean on your own understanding.<br>
    6 In all your ways acknowledge him,<br>
    and he will direct your paths.<br>
    7 Don’t be wise in your own eyes.<br>
    Fear the Lord, and depart from evil.<br>
    8 It will be health to your body,<br>
    and nourishment to your bones.<br>
    9 Honor the Lord with your substance,<br>
    with the first fruits of all your increase;<br>
    10 so your barns will be filled with plenty,<br>
    and your vats will overflow with new wine.<br>
    11 My son, don’t despise the Lord’s discipline,<br>
    neither be weary of his reproof:<br>
    12 for whom the Lord loves, he reproves,<br>
    even as a father reproves the son in whom he delights.<br>
    13 Happy is the man who finds wisdom,<br>
    the man who gets understanding.<br>
    14 For her good profit is better than getting silver,<br>
    and her return is better than fine gold.<br>
    15 She is more precious than rubies.<br>
    None of the things you can desire are to be compared to her.<br>
    16 Length of days is in her right hand.<br>
    In her left hand are riches and honor.<br>
    17 Her ways are ways of pleasantness.<br>
    All her paths are peace.<br>
    18 She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her.<br>
    Happy is everyone who retains her.

  <h3>Sirach</h3>
  <h4>Sirach 4</h4>
  <p>
    1 My son, don’t deprive the poor of his living.<br>
    Don’t make the needy eyes wait long.<br>
    2 Don’t make a hungry soul sorrowful,<br>
    or provoke a man in his distress.<br>
    3 Don’t add more trouble to a heart that is provoked.<br>
    Don’t delay to give to him who is in need.<br>
    4 Don’t reject a supplicant in affliction.<br>
    Don’t turn your face away from a poor man.<br>
    5 Don’t avert your eye from one who begs,<br>
    and give him no occasion to curse you;<br>
    6 for if he curses you in the bitterness of his soul,<br>
    he who made him will hear his prayer.<br>
    7 Endear yourself to the assembly.<br>
    Bow your head to a great man.<br>
    8 Incline your ear to the poor,<br>
    and answer him peaceably and gently.<br>
    9 Deliver him who is wronged from the hand of the wrongdoer.<br>
    Don’t be hesitant in giving judgment.<br>
    10 Be as a father to the fatherless,<br>
    and as a husband to their mother.<br>
    So you will be as a son of the Most High,<br>
    and he will love you more than your mother does.<br>
    11 Wisdom exalts her children,<br>
    and takes hold of those who seek her.<br>
    12 He who loves her loves life.<br>
    Those who seek her early will be filled with gladness.<br>
    13 He who holds her fast will inherit glory.<br>
    Wherever he enters, the Lord will bless.<br>
    14 Those who serve her will minister to the Holy One.<br>
    The Lord loves those who love her.<br>
    15 He who obeys her will judge the nations.<br>
    He who gives heed to her will live securely.<br>
    16 If a man trusts her, he will inherit her,<br>
    and his generations will have her in possession.<br>
    17 For at first she will walk with him in crooked ways,<br>
    and bring fear and dread upon him,<br>
    and torment him with her discipline<br>
    until she may trust his soul, and test him by her judgments.<br>
    18 Then she will come straight back to him,<br>
    and comfort him,<br>
    and reveal her secrets to him.<br>
    19 If he goes astray, she will forsake him,<br>
    and hand him over to his fall.<br>
    20 Observe the opportunity, and beware of evil.<br>
    Don’t be ashamed of your soul.<br>
    21 For there is a shame that brings sin;<br>
    and there is a shame that is glory and grace.<br>
    22 Don’t show partiality against your soul,<br>
    and don’t revere any man to your falling.<br>
    23 Don’t withhold a word in time of need.<br>
    Don’t conceal your wisdom for beauty’s sake.<br>
    24 For wisdom is known by speech,<br>
    and instruction by the word of the tongue.<br>
    25 In no way speak against the truth,<br>
    and be ashamed of your ignorance.<br>
    26 Don’t be ashamed to confess your sins.<br>
    Don’t fight the river’s current.<br>
    27 Don’t lay yourself down for a fool to tread upon.<br>
    Don’t be partial to one who is mighty.<br>
    28 Strive for the truth to death,<br>
    and the Lord God will fight for you.<br>
    29 Don’t be hasty in your words.<br>
    Don’t be slack and remiss in your deeds.<br>
    30 Don’t be like a lion in your house,<br>
    or suspicious of your servants.<br>
    31 Don’t let your hand be stretched out to receive,<br>
    but shut when it is time to repay.

  <h3>Psalms</h3>

  <h4>Psalm 14</h4>
  <p>
    1 The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.”<br>
    They are corrupt. They have done abominable deeds.<br>
    There is no one who does good.<br>
    2 The Lord looked down from heaven on the children of men,<br>
    to see if there were any who understood,<br>
    who sought after God.<br>
    3 They have all gone aside. They have together become corrupt.<br>
    There is no one who does good, no, not one.<br>
    4 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge,<br>
    who eat up my people as they eat bread,<br>
    and don’t call on the Lord?<br>
    5 There they were in great fear,<br>
    for God is in the generation of the righteous.<br>
    6 You frustrate the plan of the poor,<br>
    because the Lord is his refuge.<br>
    7 Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion!<br>
    When the Lord restores the fortunes of his people,<br>
    then Jacob shall rejoice,<br>
    and Israel shall be glad.

  <h4>Psalm 15</h4>
  <p>
    1 Lord, who shall dwell in your sanctuary?<br>
    Who shall live on your holy hill?<br>
    2 He who walks blamelessly does what is right,<br>
    and speaks truth in his heart;<br>
    3 he who doesn’t slander with his tongue,<br>
    nor does evil to his friend,<br>
    nor casts slurs against his fellow man;<br>
    4 in whose eyes a vile man is despised,<br>
    but who honors those who fear the Lord;<br>
    he who keeps an oath even when it hurts,<br>
    and doesn’t change;<br>
    5 he who doesn’t lend out his money for usury,<br>
    nor take a bribe against the innocent.<br>
    He who does these things shall never be shaken.

  <h4>Psalm 16</h4>
  <p>
    1 Preserve me, God, for I take refuge in you.<br>
    2 My soul, you have said to the Lord, “You are my Lord.<br>
    Apart from you I have no good thing.”<br>
    3 As for the saints who are in the earth,<br>
    they are the excellent ones in whom is all my delight.<br>
    4 Their sorrows shall be multiplied who give gifts to another god.<br>
    Their drink offerings of blood I will not offer,<br>
    nor take their names on my lips.<br>
    5 The Lord assigned my portion and my cup.<br>
    You made my lot secure.<br>
    6 The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places.<br>
    Yes, I have a good inheritance.<br>
    7 I will bless the Lord, who has given me counsel.<br>
    Yes, my heart instructs me in the night seasons.<br>
    8 I have set the Lord always before me.<br>
    Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.<br>
    9 Therefore my heart is glad, and my tongue rejoices.<br>
    My body shall also dwell in safety.<br>
    10 For you will not leave my soul in Sheol,<br>
    neither will you allow your holy one to see corruption.<br>
    11 You will show me the path of life.<br>
    In your presence is fullness of joy.<br>
    In your right hand there are pleasures forever more.

  <h4>Psalm 17</h4>
  <p>
    1 Hear, Lord, my righteous plea.<br>
    Give ear to my prayer, that doesn’t go out of deceitful lips.<br>
    2 Let my sentence come out of your presence.<br>
    Let your eyes look on equity.<br>
    3 You have proved my heart. You have visited me in the night.<br>
    You have tried me and found nothing.<br>
    I have resolved that my mouth shall not disobey.<br>
    4 As for the deeds of men, by the word of your lips,<br>
    I have kept myself from the ways of the violent.<br>
    5 My steps have held fast to your paths.<br>
    My feet have not slipped.<br>
    6 I have called on you, for you will answer me, God.<br>
    Turn your ear to me. Hear my speech.<br>
    7 Show your marvelous loving kindness,<br>
    you who save those who take refuge by your right hand from their enemies.<br>
    8 Keep me as the apple of your eye.<br>
    Hide me under the shadow of your wings,<br>
    9 from the wicked who oppress me,<br>
    my deadly enemies, who surround me.<br>
    10 They close up their callous hearts.<br>
    With their mouth they speak proudly.<br>
    11 They have now surrounded us in our steps.<br>
    They set their eyes to cast us down to the earth.<br>
    12 He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey,<br>
    as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.<br>
    13 Arise, Lord, confront him. Cast him down.<br>
    Deliver my soul from the wicked by your sword,<br>
    14 from men by your hand, Lord,<br>
    from men of the world, whose portion is in this life.<br>
    You fill the belly of your cherished ones.<br>
    Your sons have plenty, and they store up wealth for their children.<br>
    15 As for me, I shall see your face in righteousness.<br>
    I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with seeing your form.

    1 Don’t set your heart on your wealth.<br>
    Don’t say, “I have enough for my life.”<br>
    2 Don’t follow your own mind and your strength,<br>
    to walk in the desires of your heart.<br>
    3 Don’t say, “Who will have dominion over me?”<br>
    For the Lord will surely punish you.<br>
    4 Don’t say, “I sinned, and what happened to me?”<br>
    For the Lord is patient.<br>
    5 Don’t be so sure of atonement<br>
    that you add sin upon sins.<br>
    6 Don’t say, “His compassion is great.<br>
    He will be pacified for the multitude of my sins,”<br>
    for mercy and wrath are with him,<br>
    and his indignation will rest on sinners.<br>
    7 Don’t delay to turn to the Lord.<br>
    Don’t postpone it from day to day,<br>
    for suddenly the wrath of the Lord will come on you,<br>
    and you will perish in the time of vengeance.<br>
    8 Don’t set your heart on dishonest wealth,<br>
    for it will profit you nothing in the day of calamity.<br>
    9 Don’t winnow with every wind.<br>
    Don’t walk in every path.<br>
    This is what the sinner who has a double tongue does.<br>
    10 Be steadfast in your understanding,<br>
    and let your speech be consistent.<br>
    11 Be swift to hear,<br>
    and answer with patience.<br>
    12 If you have understanding, answer your neighbor;<br>
    but if not, put your hand over your mouth.<br>
    13 Glory and dishonor come from speaking.<br>
    A man’s tongue can be his downfall.<br>
    14 Don’t be called a whisperer.<br>
    Don’t lie in wait with your tongue;<br>
    for shame is on the thief,<br>
    and an evil condemnation on the double-tongued.<br>
    15 In a great or in a small matter, don’t be partial.

  <h4>Psalm 18</h4>
  <p>
    1 I love you, Lord, my strength.<br>
    2 The Lord is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer;<br>
    my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge;<br>
    my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower.<br>
    3 I call on the Lord, who is worthy to be praised;<br>
    and I am saved from my enemies.<br>
    4 The cords of death surrounded me.<br>
    The floods of ungodliness made me afraid.<br>
    5 The cords of Sheol were around me.<br>
    The snares of death came on me.<br>
    6 In my distress I called on the Lord,<br>
    and cried to my God.<br>
    He heard my voice out of his temple.<br>
    My cry before him came into his ears.<br>
    7 Then the earth shook and trembled.<br>
    The foundations also of the mountains quaked and were shaken,<br>
    because he was angry.<br>
    8 Smoke went out of his nostrils.<br>
    Consuming fire came out of his mouth.<br>
    Coals were kindled by it.<br>
    9 He bowed the heavens also, and came down.<br>
    Thick darkness was under his feet.<br>
    10 He rode on a cherub, and flew.<br>
    Yes, he soared on the wings of the wind.<br>
    11 He made darkness his hiding place, his pavilion around him,<br>
    darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.<br>
    12 At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed,<br>
    hailstones and coals of fire.<br>
    13 The Lord also thundered in the sky.<br>
    The Most High uttered his voice—<br>
    hailstones and coals of fire.<br>
    14 He sent out his arrows, and scattered them.<br>
    He hurled lightning, and routed them.<br>
    15 Then the channels of waters appeared.<br>
    The foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke, Lord,<br>
    at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.<br>
    16 He sent from on high. He took me.<br>
    He drew me out of many waters.<br>
    17 He delivered me from my strong enemy,<br>
    from those who hated me; for they were too mighty for me.<br>
    18 They came on me in the day of my calamity,<br>
    but the Lord was my support.<br>
    19 He brought me out also into a large place.<br>
    He delivered me, because he delighted in me.<br>
    20 The Lord has rewarded me according to my righteousness.<br>
    According to the cleanness of my hands he has repaid me.<br>
    21 For I have kept the ways of the Lord,<br>
    and have not wickedly departed from my God.<br>
    22 For all his ordinances were before me.<br>
    I didn’t put away his statutes from me.<br>
    23 I was also blameless with him.<br>
    I kept myself from my iniquity.<br>
    24 Therefore the Lord has rewarded me according to my righteousness,<br>
    according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.<br>
    25 With the merciful you will show yourself merciful.<br>
    With the perfect man, you will show yourself perfect.<br>
    26 With the pure, you will show yourself pure.<br>
    With the crooked you will show yourself shrewd.<br>
    27 For you will save the afflicted people,<br>
    but the arrogant eyes you will bring down.<br>
    28 For you will light my lamp, Lord.<br>
    My God will light up my darkness.<br>
    29 For by you, I advance through a troop.<br>
    By my God, I leap over a wall.<br>
    30 As for God, his way is perfect.<br>
    The Lord’s word is tried.<br>
    He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.<br>
    31 For who is God, except the Lord?<br>
    Who is a rock besides our God,<br>
    32 the God who arms me with strength, and makes my way perfect?<br>
    33 He makes my feet like deer’s feet,<br>
    and sets me on my high places.<br>
    34 He teaches my hands to war,<br>
    so that my arms bend a bow of bronze.<br>
    35 You have also given me the shield of your salvation.<br>
    Your right hand sustains me.<br>
    Your gentleness has made me great.<br>
    36 You have enlarged my steps under me,<br>
    and my feet have not slipped.<br>
    37 I will pursue my enemies, and overtake them.<br>
    I won’t turn away until they are consumed.<br>
    38 I will strike them through, so that they will not be able to rise.<br>
    They shall fall under my feet.<br>
    39 For you have armed me with strength to the battle.<br>
    You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.<br>
    40 You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me,<br>
    that I might cut off those who hate me.<br>
    41 They cried, but there was no one to save;<br>
    even to the Lord, but he didn’t answer them.<br>
    42 Then I beat them small as the dust before the wind.<br>
    I cast them out as the mire of the streets.<br>
    43 You have delivered me from the strivings of the people.<br>
    You have made me the head of the nations.<br>
    A people whom I have not known shall serve me.<br>
    44 As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me.<br>
    The foreigners shall submit themselves to me.<br>
    45 The foreigners shall fade away,<br>
    and shall come trembling out of their strongholds.<br>
    46 The Lord lives! Blessed be my rock.<br>
    Exalted be the God of my salvation,<br>
    47 even the God who executes vengeance for me,<br>
    and subdues peoples under me.<br>
    48 He rescues me from my enemies.<br>
    Yes, you lift me up above those who rise up against me.<br>
    You deliver me from the violent man.<br>
    49 Therefore I will give thanks to you, Lord, among the nations,<br>
    and will sing praises to your name.<br>
    50 He gives great deliverance to his king,<br>
    and shows loving kindness to his anointed,<br>
    to David and to his offspring forever more.

  <p>
    1 Listen, sons, to a father’s instruction.<br>
    Pay attention to know understanding;<br>
    2 for I give you sound learning.<br>
    Don’t forsake my law.<br>
    3 For I was a son to my father,<br>
    tender and an only child in the sight of my mother.<br>
    4 He taught me, and said to me:<br>
    “Let your heart retain my words.<br>
    Keep my commandments, and live.<br>
    5 Get wisdom. Get understanding.<br>
    Don’t forget, and don’t deviate from the words of my mouth.<br>
    6 Don’t forsake her, and she will preserve you.<br>
    Love her, and she will keep you.<br>
    7 Wisdom is supreme. Get wisdom.<br>
    Yes, though it costs all your possessions, get understanding.<br>
    8 Esteem her, and she will exalt you.<br>
    She will bring you honor when you embrace her.<br>
    9 She will give to your head a garland of grace.<br>
    She will deliver a crown of splendor to you.”

  <!-- Sirach 6 -->
  <h3>Sirach</h3>
  <h4>Sirach 6</h4>
  <p>
    1 Don’t be an enemy instead of a friend;<br>
    for an evil name will inherit shame and reproach.<br>
    So it is with the sinner who has a double tongue.<br>
    2 Don’t exalt yourself in the counsel of your soul,<br>
    that your soul not be torn in pieces like a bull.<br>
    3 You will devour your leaves and destroy your fruit,<br>
    and leave yourself like a dry tree.<br>
    4 A wicked soul will destroy him who has it,<br>
    and make him a laughing stock to his enemies.<br>
    5 A pleasant voice multiplies friends.<br>
    A gracious tongue multiplies courtesies.<br>
    6 Let those who are at peace with you be many,<br>
    but let your counselors be one in a thousand.<br>
    7 If you want to get a friend, test him,<br>
    and don’t be in a hurry to trust him.<br>
    8 For there is a friend who is so for his own occasion,<br>
    and will not continue in the day of your affliction.<br>
    9 There is also a friend who turns to enmity,<br>
    and will reveal strife to your reproach.<br>
    10 Again, there is a friend who is a companion at the table,<br>
    and will not continue in the day of your affliction.<br>
    11 In your prosperity he will be as yourself,<br>
    and will be bold over your servants.<br>
    12 If you are brought low, he will be against you,<br>
    and will hide himself from your face.<br>
    13 Separate yourself from your enemies,<br>
    and beware of your friends.<br>
    14 A faithful friend is a strong defense.<br>
    He who has found him has found a treasure.<br>
    15 There is nothing that can be taken in exchange for a faithful friend.<br>
    His excellency is beyond price.<br>
    16 A faithful friend is a medicine of life.<br>
    Those who fear the Lord will find him.<br>
    17 He who fears the Lord directs his friendship properly,<br>
    for as he is, so is his neighbor also.<br>
    18 My son, gather instruction from your youth up.<br>
    So you will find wisdom until you grow old.<br>
    19 Come to her as one who plows and sows,<br>
    and wait for her good fruits;<br>
    for you will toil a little in her work,<br>
    and will quickly eat of her fruits.<br>
    20 She is very unpleasant to the unlearned.<br>
    He who is without understanding will not remain in her.<br>
    21 She will rest upon him as a mighty stone of trial.<br>
    He will not delay to cast her from him.<br>
    22 For wisdom is according to her name,<br>
    and is not manifest to many.<br>
    23 Listen, my son, and receive my instruction.<br>
    Don’t refuse my counsel.<br>
    24 Put your feet into her fetters,<br>
    and your neck into her chain.<br>
    25 Put your shoulder under her and bear her.<br>
    Don’t be grieved with her bonds.<br>
    26 Come to her with all your soul,<br>
    and keep her ways with all your power.<br>
    27 Search and seek, and she will be made known to you.<br>
    When you get hold of her, don’t let her go.<br>
    28 For at the last you will find her rest,<br>
    and she will be turned into your joy.<br>
    29 Then her fetters will be a strong defense for you,<br>
    and her chains a robe of glory.<br>
    30 For there is a golden ornament on her,<br>
    and her bonds are blue lace.<br>
    31 You will wear her as a glorious robe,<br>
    and put her on as a crown of gladness.<br>
    32 My son, if you will, you will be instructed.<br>
    If you will yield your soul, you will be prudent.<br>
    33 If you love to hear, you will receive.<br>
    If you incline your ear, you will be wise.<br>
    34 Stand in the multitude of the elders.<br>
    Attach yourself to whoever is wise.<br>
    35 Be willing to listen to every godly discourse.<br>
    Don’t let the proverbs of understanding escape you.<br>
    36 If you see a man of understanding, get early to him.<br>
    Let your foot wear out the steps of his doors.<br>
    37 Let your mind dwell on the ordinances of the Lord,<br>
    and meditate continually on his commandments.<br>
    He will establish your heart,<br>
    and your desire for wisdom will be given to you.

  <!-- Psalms 19, 20, 21 -->
  <h3>Psalms</h3>

  <h4>Psalm 19</h4>
  <p>
    1 The heavens declare the glory of God.<br>
    The expanse shows his handiwork.<br>
    2 Day after day they pour out speech,<br>
    and night after night they display knowledge.<br>
    3 There is no speech nor language<br>
    where their voice is not heard.<br>
    4 Their voice has gone out through all the earth,<br>
    their words to the end of the world.<br>
    In them he has set a tent for the sun,<br>
    5 which is as a bridegroom coming out of his room,<br>
    like a strong man rejoicing to run his course.<br>
    6 His going out is from the end of the heavens,<br>
    his circuit to its ends.<br>
    There is nothing hidden from its heat.<br>
    7 The Lord’s law is perfect, restoring the soul.<br>
    The Lord’s testimony is sure, making wise the simple.<br>
    8 The Lord’s precepts are right, rejoicing the heart.<br>
    The Lord’s commandment is pure, enlightening the eyes.<br>
    9 The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever.<br>
    The Lord’s ordinances are true, and righteous altogether.<br>
    10 They are more to be desired than gold, yes, than much fine gold,<br>
    sweeter also than honey and the extract of the honeycomb.<br>
    11 Moreover your servant is warned by them.<br>
    In keeping them there is great reward.<br>
    12 Who can discern his errors?<br>
    Forgive me from hidden errors.<br>
    13 Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins.<br>
    Let them not have dominion over me.<br>
    Then I will be upright.<br>
    I will be blameless and innocent of great transgression.<br>
    14 Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart<br>
    be acceptable in your sight,<br>
    Lord, my rock, and my redeemer.

  <h4>Psalm 20</h4>
  <p>
    1 May the Lord answer you in the day of trouble.<br>
    May the name of the God of Jacob set you up on high,<br>
    2 send you help from the sanctuary,<br>
    grant you support from Zion,<br>
    3 remember all your offerings,<br>
    and accept your burnt sacrifice.<br>
    Selah.<br>
    4 May he grant you your heart’s desire,<br>
    and fulfill all your counsel.<br>
    5 We will triumph in your salvation.<br>
    In the name of our God, we will set up our banners.<br>
    May the Lord grant all your requests.<br>
    6 Now I know that the Lord saves his anointed.<br>
    He will answer him from his holy heaven,<br>
    with the saving strength of his right hand.<br>
    7 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses,<br>
    but we trust the name of the Lord our God.<br>
    8 They are bowed down and fallen,<br>
    but we rise up, and stand upright.<br>
    9 Save, Lord!<br>
    Let the King answer us when we call!
  </p>

  <h4>Psalm 21</h4>
  <p>
    1 The king rejoices in your strength, Lord!<br>
    How greatly he rejoices in your salvation!<br>
    2 You have given him his heart’s desire,<br>
    and have not withheld the request of his lips.<br>
    Selah.<br>
    3 For you meet him with the blessings of goodness.<br>
    You set a crown of fine gold on his head.<br>
    4 He asked life of you, and you gave it to him,<br>
    even length of days forever and ever.<br>
    5 His glory is great in your salvation.<br>
    You lay honor and majesty on him.<br>
    6 For you make him most blessed forever.<br>
    You make him glad with joy in your presence.<br>
    7 For the king trusts in the Lord.<br>
    Through the loving kindness of the Most High, he shall not be moved.<br>
    8 Your hand will find out all of your enemies.<br>
    Your right hand will find out those who hate you.<br>
    9 You will make them as a fiery furnace in the time of your anger.<br>
    The Lord will swallow them up in his wrath.<br>
    The fire shall devour them.<br>
    10 You will destroy their descendants from the earth,<br>
    their posterity from among the children of men.<br>
    11 For they intended evil against you.<br>
    They plotted evil against you which cannot succeed.<br>
    12 For you will make them turn their back<br>
    when you aim drawn bows at their face.<br>
    13 Be exalted, Lord, in your strength,<br>
    so we will sing and praise your power.

    11 I have taught you in the way of wisdom.<br>
    I have led you in straight paths.<br>
    12 When you go, your steps will not be hampered.<br>
    When you run, you will not stumble.<br>
    13 Take firm hold of instruction.<br>
    Don’t let her go.<br>
    Keep her, for she is your life.<br>
    14 Don’t enter into the path of the wicked.<br>
    Don’t walk in the way of evil men.<br>
    15 Avoid it, and don’t pass by it.<br>
    Turn from it, and pass on.<br>
    16 For they don’t sleep unless they do evil.<br>
    Their sleep is taken away, unless they make someone fall.<br>
    17 For they eat the bread of wickedness,<br>
    and drink the wine of violence.<br>

    that shines more and more until the perfect day.<br>
    19 The way of the wicked is like darkness.<br>

    Turn your ear to my sayings.<br>

    Keep them in the center of your heart.<br>
    22 For they are life to those who find them,<br>
    and health to their whole body.<br>
    23 Keep your heart with all diligence,<br>
    for out of it is the wellspring of life.<br>
    24 Put away from yourself a perverse mouth.<br>
    Put corrupt lips far from you.<br>
    25 Let your eyes look straight ahead.<br>
    Fix your gaze directly before you.<br>
    26 Make the path of your feet level.<br>
    Let all your ways be established.<br>

  <h3>Psalms</h3>

  <h4>Psalm 22</h4>
  <p>
    1 My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?<br>
    Why are you so far from helping me, and from the words of my groaning?<br>
    2 My God, I cry in the daytime, but you don’t answer;<br>
    in the night season, and am not silent.<br>
    3 But you are holy,<br>
    you who inhabit the praises of Israel.<br>
    4 Our fathers trusted in you.<br>
    They trusted, and you delivered them.<br>
    5 They cried to you, and were delivered.<br>
    They trusted in you, and were not disappointed.<br>
    6 But I am a worm, and no man;<br>
    a reproach of men, and despised by the people.<br>
    7 All those who see me mock me.<br>
    They insult me with their lips. They shake their heads, saying,<br>
    8 “He trusts in the Lord. Let him deliver him.<br>
    Let him rescue him, since he delights in him.”<br>
    9 But you brought me out of the womb.<br>
    You made me trust at my mother’s breasts.<br>
    10 I was thrown on you from my mother’s womb.<br>
    You are my God since my mother bore me.<br>
    11 Don’t be far from me, for trouble is near.<br>
    For there is no one to help.<br>
    12 Many bulls have surrounded me.<br>
    Strong bulls of Bashan have encircled me.<br>
    13 They open their mouths wide against me,<br>
    lions tearing prey and roaring.<br>
    14 I am poured out like water.<br>
    All my bones are out of joint.<br>
    My heart is like wax.<br>
    It is melted within me.<br>
    15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd.<br>
    My tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth.<br>
    You have brought me into the dust of death.<br>
    16 For dogs have surrounded me.<br>
    A company of evildoers have enclosed me.<br>
    They have pierced my hands and feet.<br>
    17 I can count all of my bones.<br>
    They look and stare at me.<br>
    18 They divide my garments among them.<br>
    They cast lots for my clothing.<br>
    19 But don’t be far off, Lord.<br>
    You are my help. Hurry to help me.<br>
    20 Deliver my soul from the sword,<br>
    my precious life from the power of the dog.<br>
    21 Save me from the lion’s mouth!<br>
    Yes, you have rescued me from the horns of the wild oxen.<br>
    22 I will declare your name to my brothers.<br>
    Among the assembly, I will praise you.<br>
    23 You who fear the Lord, praise him!<br>
    All you descendants of Jacob, glorify him!<br>
    Stand in awe of him, all you descendants of Israel!<br>
    24 For he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted,<br>
    neither has he hidden his face from him;<br>
    but when he cried to him, he heard.<br>
    25 My praise of you comes in the great assembly.<br>
    I will pay my vows before those who fear him.<br>
    26 The humble shall eat and be satisfied.<br>
    They shall praise the Lord who seek after him.<br>
    Let your hearts live forever.<br>
    27 All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the Lord.<br>
    All the relatives of the nations shall worship before you.<br>
    28 For the kingdom is the Lord’s.<br>
    He is the ruler over the nations.<br>
    29 All the rich ones of the earth shall eat and worship.<br>
    All those who go down to the dust shall bow before him,<br>
    even he who can’t keep his soul alive.<br>
    30 Posterity shall serve him.<br>
    Future generations shall be told about the Lord.<br>
    31 They shall come and shall declare his righteousness to a people that shall be born,<br>
    for he has done it.

    1 The Lord is my shepherd:<br>
    I shall lack nothing.<br>
    2 He makes me lie down in green pastures.<br>
    He leads me beside still waters.<br>
    3 He restores my soul.<br>
    He guides me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake.<br>
    4 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,<br>
    I will fear no evil, for you are with me.<br>
    Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.<br>
    5 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.<br>
    You anoint my head with oil.<br>
    My cup runs over.<br>
    6 Surely goodness and loving kindness shall follow me all the days of my life,<br>
    and I will dwell in the Lord’s house forever.

    and established it on the floods.<br>
    3 Who may ascend to the Lord’s hill?<br>
    Who may stand in his holy place?<br>
    4 He who has clean hands and a pure heart;<br>
    who has not lifted up his soul to falsehood,<br>
    and has not sworn deceitfully.<br>
    5 He shall receive a blessing from the Lord,<br>
    righteousness from the God of his salvation.<br>
    6 This is the generation of those who seek Him,<br>
    who seek your face—even Jacob.<br>

    7 Lift up your heads, you gates!<br>
    Be lifted up, you everlasting doors,<br>
    and the King of glory will come in.<br>
    8 Who is the King of glory?<br>
    The Lord strong and mighty,<br>
    the Lord mighty in battle.<br>
    9 Lift up your heads, you gates;<br>
    yes, lift them up, you everlasting doors,<br>
    and the King of glory will come in.<br>
    10 Who is this King of glory?<br>
    The Lord of Armies<br>
    is the King of glory!<br>

  <p>
    1 My son, pay attention to my wisdom.<br>
    Turn your ear to my understanding,<br>
    2 that you may maintain discretion,<br>
    that your lips may preserve knowledge.<br>
    3 For the lips of an adulteress drip honey.<br>
    Her mouth is smoother than oil,<br>
    4 but in the end she is as bitter as wormwood,<br>
    and as sharp as a two-edged sword.<br>
    5 Her feet go down to death.<br>
    Her steps lead straight to Sheol.<br>
    6 She gives no thought to the way of life.<br>
    Her ways are crooked, and she doesn’t know it.<br>
    7 Now therefore, my sons, listen to me.<br>
    Don’t depart from the words of my mouth.<br>
    8 Remove your way far from her.<br>
    Don’t come near the door of her house,<br>
    9 lest you give your honor to others,<br>
    and your years to the cruel one;<br>
    10 lest strangers feast on your wealth,<br>
    and your labors enrich another man’s house.<br>
    11 You will groan at your latter end,<br>
    when your flesh and your body are consumed,<br>
    12 and say, “How I have hated instruction,<br>
    and my heart despised reproof;<br>
    13 neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers,<br>
    nor turned my ear to those who instructed me!<br>
    14 I have come to the brink of utter ruin,<br>
    among the gathered assembly.”

  <h4>Psalm 25</h4>
  <p>
    1 To you, Lord, do I lift up my soul.<br>
    2 My God, I have trusted in you.<br>
    Don’t let me be shamed.<br>
    Don’t let my enemies triumph over me.<br>
    3 Yes, no one who waits for you will be shamed.<br>
    They will be shamed who deal treacherously without cause.<br>
    4 Show me your ways, Lord.<br>
    Teach me your paths.<br>
    5 Guide me in your truth, and teach me,<br>
    For you are the God of my salvation,<br>
    I wait for you all day long.<br>
    6 Lord, remember your tender mercies and your loving kindness,<br>
    for they are from old times.<br>
    7 Don’t remember the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions.<br>
    Remember me according to your loving kindness,<br>
    for your goodness’ sake, Lord.<br>
    8 Good and upright is the Lord.<br>
    Therefore he will instruct sinners in the way.<br>
    9 He will guide the humble in justice.<br>
    He will teach the humble his way.<br>
    10 All the paths of the Lord are loving kindness and truth<br>
    to such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.<br>
    11 For your name’s sake, Lord,<br>
    pardon my iniquity, for it is great.<br>
    12 What man is he who fears the Lord?<br>
    He shall instruct him in the way that he shall choose.<br>
    13 His soul will dwell at ease.<br>
    His offspring will inherit the land.<br>
    14 The friendship of the Lord is with those who fear him.<br>
    He will show them his covenant.<br>
    15 My eyes are ever on the Lord,<br>
    for he will pluck my feet out of the net.<br>
    16 Turn to me, and have mercy on me,<br>
    for I am desolate and afflicted.<br>
    17 The troubles of my heart are enlarged.<br>
    Oh bring me out of my distresses.<br>
    18 Consider my affliction and my travail.<br>
    Forgive all my sins.<br>
    19 Consider my enemies, for they are many.<br>
    They hate me with cruel hatred.<br>
    20 Oh keep my soul, and deliver me.<br>
    Let me not be disappointed, for I take refuge in you.<br>
    21 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me,<br>
    for I wait for you.<br>
    22 Redeem Israel, God,<br>
    out of all his troubles.
  </p>

  <h4>Psalm 26</h4>
  <p>
    1 Judge me, Lord, for I have walked in my integrity.<br>
    I have trusted also in the Lord without wavering.<br>
    2 Examine me, Lord, and prove me.<br>
    Try my heart and my mind.<br>
    3 For your loving kindness is before my eyes.<br>
    I have walked in your truth.<br>
    4 I have not sat with deceitful men,<br>
    neither will I go in with hypocrites.<br>
    5 I hate the assembly of evildoers,<br>
    and will not sit with the wicked.<br>
    6 I will wash my hands in innocence,<br>
    so I will go about your altar, Lord;<br>
    7 that I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard<br>
    and tell of all your wondrous deeds.<br>
    8 Lord, I love the habitation of your house,<br>
    the place where your glory dwells.<br>
    9 Don’t gather my soul with sinners,<br>
    nor my life with bloodthirsty men;<br>
    10 in whose hands is wickedness;<br>
    their right hand is full of bribes.<br>
    11 But as for me, I will walk in my integrity.<br>
    Redeem me, and be merciful to me.<br>
    12 My foot stands in an even place.<br>
    In the congregations I will bless the Lord.

  <h4>Psalm 27</h4>
  <p>
    1 The Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom shall I fear?<br>
    The Lord is the strength of my life. Of whom shall I be afraid?<br>
    2 When evildoers came at me to eat up my flesh,<br>
    even my adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell.<br>
    3 Though an army should encamp against me,<br>
    my heart shall not fear.<br>
    Though war should rise against me,<br>
    even then I will be confident.<br>
    4 One thing I have asked of the Lord, that I will seek after:<br>
    that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life,<br>
    to see the Lord’s beauty,<br>
    and to inquire in his temple.<br>
    5 For in the day of trouble he will keep me secretly in his pavilion.<br>
    In the covert of his tent he will hide me.<br>
    He will lift me up on a rock.<br>
    6 Now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me.<br>
    I will offer sacrifices of joy in his tent.<br>
    I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to the Lord.<br>
    7 Hear, Lord, when I cry with my voice.<br>
    Have mercy also on me, and answer me.<br>
    8 When you said, “Seek my face,”<br>
    my heart said to you, “I will seek your face, Lord.”<br>
    9 Don’t hide your face from me.<br>
    Don’t put your servant away in anger.<br>
    You have been my help.<br>
    Don’t abandon me, neither forsake me, God of my salvation.<br>
    10 When my father and my mother forsake me,<br>
    then the Lord will take me up.<br>
    11 Teach me your way, Lord.<br>
    Lead me in a straight path, because of my enemies.<br>
    12 Don’t deliver me over to the desire of my adversaries,<br>
    for false witnesses have risen up against me,<br>
    such as breathe out cruelty.<br>
    13 I am still confident of this:<br>
    I will see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.<br>
    14 Wait for the Lord.<br>
    Be strong, and let your heart take courage.<br>
    Yes, wait for the Lord.

  <p>
    1 Don’t be jealous over the wife of your bosom,<br>
    and don’t teach her an evil lesson against yourself.<br>
    2 Don’t give your soul to a woman,<br>
    that she should set herself over your strength.<br>
    3 Don’t go to meet a woman who plays the prostitute,<br>
    lest perhaps you fall into her snares.<br>
    4 Don’t associate with a woman singer,<br>
    lest you be caught by her attempts.<br>
    5 Don’t gaze at a maid, lest you fall by those things<br>
    that are precious in her.<br>
    6 Don’t give your soul to prostitutes,<br>
    that you not lose your inheritance.<br>
    7 Don’t look around in the streets of the city,<br>
    neither wander in its deserted places.<br>
    8 Turn your eye away from a beautiful woman,<br>
    and don’t gaze at another’s beauty.<br>
    Many have been led astray by the beauty of a woman,<br>
    and with it passion is kindled like a fire.<br>
    9 Don’t sit at all with another man’s wife,<br>
    or share the wine with her in revelry,<br>
    lest your heart turn away from her,<br>
    and you go down in blood to the pit.<br>
    10 Don’t forsake an old friend,<br>
    for the new is not comparable to him.<br>
    A new friend is like new wine.<br>
    If it becomes old, you will drink it with gladness.<br>
    11 Don’t envy the glory of a sinner,<br>
    for you don’t know what his end will be.<br>
    12 Don’t delight in the delights of the ungodly.<br>
    Remember they will not go unpunished to the grave.<br>
    13 Keep yourself far from the man who has power to kill,<br>
    and you will have no suspicion of the fear of death.<br>
    If you do come to him, commit no offense,<br>
    lest he take away your life.<br>
    Know that you go among snares,<br>
    and walk upon the battlements of the city.<br>
    14 As much as possible, inquire of your neighbor,<br>
    and consult with the wise.<br>
    15 Let your conversation be with men of understanding.<br>
    Let all your discussion be about the law of the Most High.<br>
    16 Let righteous men be companions at your table.<br>
    Let your glory be in the fear of the Lord.<br>
    17 A work will be commended for the skill of the craftsman;<br>
    so he who rules the people will be considered wise for his speech.<br>
    18 A chatterer is feared in his city.<br>
    He who is reckless in his speech will be hated.

    1 To you, Lord, I call.<br>
    My rock, don’t be deaf to me,<br>
    lest, if you are silent to me,<br>
    I would become like those who go down into the pit.<br>
    2 Hear the voice of my petitions when I cry to you,<br>
    when I lift up my hands toward your Most Holy Place.<br>
    3 Don’t draw me away with the wicked,<br>
    with the workers of iniquity who speak peace with their neighbors,<br>
    but mischief is in their hearts.<br>
    4 Give them according to their work,<br>
    and according to the wickedness of their doings.<br>
    Give them according to the operation of their hands.<br>
    Bring back on them what they deserve.<br>
    5 Because they don’t respect the works of the Lord,<br>
    nor the operation of his hands,<br>
    he will break them down and not build them up.<br>
    6 Blessed be the Lord,<br>
    because he has heard the voice of my petitions.<br>
    7 The Lord is my strength and my shield.<br>
    My heart has trusted in him, and I am helped.<br>
    Therefore my heart greatly rejoices.<br>
    With my song I will thank him.<br>

    2 Ascribe to the Lord the glory due to his name.<br>
    Worship the Lord in holy array.<br>
    3 The Lord’s voice is on the waters.<br>
    The God of glory thunders, even the Lord on many waters.<br>
    4 The Lord’s voice is powerful.<br>
    The Lord’s voice is full of majesty.<br>

    Yes, the Lord breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon.<br>
    6 He makes them also to skip like a calf;<br>
    Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild ox.<br>
    7 The Lord’s voice strikes with flashes of lightning.<br>
    8 The Lord’s voice shakes the wilderness.<br>
    The Lord shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.<br>
    9 The Lord’s voice makes the deer calve,<br>
    and strips the forests bare.<br>
    In his temple everything says, “Glory!”<br>
    10 The Lord sat enthroned at the Flood.<br>
    Yes, the Lord sits as King forever.<br>

  <h4>Psalm 30</h4>
  <p>
    1 I will extol you, Lord, for you have raised me up,<br>
    and have not made my foes to rejoice over me.<br>
    2 Lord my God, I cried to you, and you have healed me.<br>
    3 Lord, you have brought up my soul from Sheol.<br>
    You have kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.<br>
    4 Sing praise to the Lord, you saints of his.<br>
    Give thanks to his holy name.<br>
    5 For his anger is but for a moment.<br>
    His favor is for a lifetime.<br>
    Weeping may stay for the night,<br>
    but joy comes in the morning.<br>
    6 As for me, I said in my prosperity, “I shall never be moved.”<br>
    7 You, Lord, when you favored me, made my mountain stand strong;<br>
    but when you hid your face, I was troubled.<br>
    8 I cried to you, Lord.<br>
    I made supplication to the Lord.<br>
    9 “What profit is there in my destruction, if I go down to the pit?<br>
    Shall the dust praise you?<br>
    Shall it declare your truth?<br>
    10 Hear, Lord, and have mercy on me.<br>
    Lord, be my helper.”<br>
    11 You have turned my mourning into dancing for me.<br>
    You have removed my sackcloth, and clothed me with gladness,<br>
    12 to the end that my heart may sing praise to you, and not be silent.<br>
    Lord my God, I will give thanks to you forever!

    2 Bow down your ear to me.<br>
    Deliver me speedily.<br>
    Be to me a strong rock,<br>
    a house of defense to save me.<br>
    3 For you are my rock and my fortress,<br>
    therefore for your name’s sake lead me and guide me.<br>
    4 Pluck me out of the net that they have laid secretly for me,<br>
    for you are my stronghold.<br>
    5 Into your hand I commend my spirit.<br>
    You redeem me, Lord, God of truth.<br>
    6 I hate those who regard lying vanities,<br>
    but I trust in the Lord.<br>
    7 I will be glad and rejoice in your loving kindness,<br>
    for you have seen my affliction.<br>
    You have known my soul in adversities.<br>
    8 You have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy.<br>
    You have set my feet in a large room.<br>
    9 Have mercy on me, Lord, for I am in distress.<br>
    My eye, my soul, and my body waste away with grief.<br>
    10 For my life is spent with sorrow,<br>
    my years with sighing.<br>
    My strength fails because of my iniquity.<br>
    My bones are wasted away.<br>
    11 Because of all my adversaries I have become utterly contemptible to my neighbors,<br>
    a horror to my acquaintances.<br>
    Those who saw me on the street fled from me.<br>
    12 I am forgotten from their hearts like a dead man.<br>
    I am like broken pottery.<br>
    13 For I have heard the slander of many, terror on every side,<br>
    while they conspire together against me,<br>
    they plot to take away my life.<br>
    14 But I trust in you, Lord.<br>
    I said, “You are my God.”<br>
    15 My times are in your hand.<br>
    Deliver me from the hand of my enemies and from those who persecute me.<br>
    16 Make your face to shine on your servant.<br>
    Save me in your loving kindness.<br>
    17 Let me not be disappointed, Lord, for I have called on you.<br>
    Let the wicked be disappointed.<br>
    Let them be silent in Sheol.<br>
    18 Let the lying lips be mute,<br>
    which speak against the righteous insolently, with pride and contempt.<br>
    19 Oh how great is your goodness,<br>
    which you have laid up for those who fear you,<br>
    which you have worked for those who take refuge in you,<br>
    before the sons of men!<br>
    20 In the shelter of your presence you will hide them from the plotting of man.<br>
    You will keep them secretly in a dwelling away from the strife of tongues.<br>
    21 Praise be to the Lord,<br>
    for he has shown me his marvelous loving kindness in a strong city.<br>
    22 As for me, I said in my haste, “I am cut off from before your eyes.”<br>
    Nevertheless, you heard the voice of my petitions when I cried to you.<br>
    23 Oh love the Lord, all you his saints!<br>
    The Lord preserves the faithful,<br>
    and fully recompenses him who behaves arrogantly.<br>
    24 Be strong, and let your heart take courage,<br>
    all you who hope in the Lord.

  <p>
    1 My son, if you have become collateral for your neighbor,<br>
    if you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger,<br>
    2 you are trapped by the words of your mouth;<br>
    you are ensnared with the words of your mouth.<br>
    3 Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself,<br>
    since you have come into the hand of your neighbor.<br>
    Go, humble yourself.<br>
    Press your plea with your neighbor.<br>
    4 Give no sleep to your eyes,<br>
    nor slumber to your eyelids.<br>
    5 Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter,<br>
    like a bird from the snare of the fowler.<br>
    6 Go to the ant, you sluggard.<br>
    Consider her ways, and be wise;<br>
    7 which has no chief, overseer, or ruler,<br>
    8 provides her bread in the summer,<br>
    and gathers her food in the harvest.<br>
    9 How long will you sleep, sluggard?<br>
    When will you arise out of your sleep?<br>
    10 A little sleep, a little slumber,<br>
    a little folding of the hands to sleep—<br>
    11 so your poverty will come as a robber,<br>
    and your scarcity as an armed man.<br>
    12 A worthless person, a man of iniquity,<br>
    is he who walks with a perverse mouth,<br>
    13 who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet,<br>
    who motions with his fingers,<br>
    14 in whose heart is perverseness,<br>
    who devises evil continually,<br>
    who always sows discord.<br>
    15 Therefore his calamity will come suddenly.<br>
    He will be broken suddenly, and that without remedy.<br>
    16 There are six things which the Lord hates;<br>
    yes, seven which are an abomination to him:<br>
    17 arrogant eyes, a lying tongue,<br>
    hands that shed innocent blood,<br>
    18 a heart that devises wicked schemes,<br>
    feet that are swift in running to mischief,<br>
    19 a false witness who utters lies,<br>
    and he who sows discord among brothers.

  <p>
    1 A wise judge will instruct his people;<br>
    and the government of a prudent man is well ordered.<br>
    2 As the judge of the people is himself, so are his officers;<br>
    and what manner of man the ruler of a city is, such are all those who dwell in it.<br>
    3 An unwise king destroys his people;<br>
    but through the understanding of those in authority the city will be inhabited.<br>
    4 The power of the earth is in the hand of the Lord,<br>
    and in due time he will set over it one who is profitable.<br>
    5 In the hand of the Lord is the prosperity of man;<br>
    and upon the person of the scribe he will lay his honor.<br>
    6 Don’t be angry with your neighbor for every wrong,<br>
    and don’t do anything by works of violence.<br>
    7 Pride is hateful before God and man;<br>
    and injustice is abhorrent to both.<br>
    8 Sovereignty is transferred from one people to another,<br>
    because of injustices, covetous deeds, and deceit of money.<br>
    9 Why are dust and ashes proud?<br>
    There is not a more wicked thing than to love money;<br>
    for the same man sets even his own soul for sale.<br>
    Because while he lives, he casts away his inner parts.<br>
    10 All power is of short life.<br>
    A long sickness wears even the physician out.<br>
    11 A physician cuts off a long disease;<br>
    and he who is king today will die tomorrow.<br>
    12 For when a man is dead,<br>
    he will inherit creeping things, wild beasts, and worms.<br>
    13 The beginning of pride is to depart from the Lord,<br>
    and arrogance is to turn away from the Almighty.<br>
    14 For because of pride comes rebellion;<br>
    he who holds to it will pour out abominations.<br>
    Therefore the Lord has brought upon them strange calamities,<br>
    and destroyed them utterly.<br>
    15 The Lord has cast down the thrones of rulers,<br>
    and has seated the meek in their place.<br>
    16 The Lord has plucked up the roots of nations,<br>
    and planted the humble in their place.<br>
    17 The Lord has overthrown the lands of nations,<br>
    and destroyed them to the foundations of the earth.<br>
    18 He has removed some of them, and destroyed them,<br>
    and has made their memory to cease from the earth.<br>
    19 Pride was not created for men,<br>
    nor wrathful anger for the offspring of women.<br>
    20 Which race is worthy of honor? The race of man.<br>
    Which race is worthy of honor? Those who fear the Lord.<br>
    Which race is unworthy of honor? The race of man.<br>
    Which race is unworthy of honor? Those who transgress the commandments.<br>
    21 In the midst of brothers their leader is honorable;<br>
    so are those who fear the Lord in his eyes.<br>
    22 The rich, the honorable, and the poor<br>
    all glory in the fear of the Lord.<br>
    23 It is not right to despise a poor man who has understanding;<br>
    and it is not fitting to glorify a man who is a sinner.<br>
    24 The great man, the judge, and the mighty man will be glorified;<br>
    and there is not one of them greater than he who fears the Lord.<br>
    25 Free men will serve a wise servant,<br>
    and a man of understanding will not complain.<br>
    26 Don’t make a display of your wisdom when you do your work,<br>
    and don’t glorify yourself in the time of your distress.<br>
    27 Better is he who labors and abounds in all things,<br>
    than he who glorifies himself and lacks bread.<br>
    28 My son, glorify your soul in humility,<br>
    and give it honor according to its worth.<br>
    29 Who will justify him who sins against his own soul?<br>
    Who will honor him who dishonors his own life?<br>
    30 A poor man is honored for his knowledge,<br>
    while a rich man is honored for his wealth.<br>
    31 But he who is honored in poverty, how much more in wealth?<br>
    And he who is dishonored in wealth, how much more in poverty?

  <h4>Psalm 32</h4>
  <p>
    1 Blessed is he whose disobedience is forgiven,<br>
    whose sin is covered.<br>
    2 Blessed is the man to whom the Lord doesn’t impute iniquity,<br>
    in whose spirit there is no deceit.<br>
    3 When I kept silence, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.<br>
    4 For day and night your hand was heavy on me.<br>
    My strength was sapped in the heat of summer.<br>
    Selah.<br>
    5 I acknowledged my sin to you.<br>
    I didn’t hide my iniquity.<br>
    I said, “I will confess my transgressions to the Lord,”<br>
    and you forgave the iniquity of my sin.<br>
    Selah.<br>
    6 For this, let everyone who is godly pray to you in a time when you may be found.<br>
    Surely when the great waters overflow, they shall not reach to him.<br>
    7 You are my hiding place.<br>
    You will preserve me from trouble.<br>
    You will surround me with songs of deliverance.<br>
    Selah.<br>
    8 I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you shall go.<br>
    I will counsel you with my eye on you.<br>
    9 Don’t be like the horse, or like the mule, which have no understanding,<br>
    who are controlled by bit and bridle, or else they will not come near to you.<br>
    10 Many sorrows come to the wicked,<br>
    but loving kindness shall surround him who trusts in the Lord.<br>
    11 Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, you righteous!<br>
    Shout for joy, all you who are upright in heart!
  </p>

  <h4>Psalm 33</h4>
  <p>
    1 Rejoice in the Lord, you righteous!<br>
    Praise is fitting for the upright.<br>
    2 Give thanks to the Lord with the lyre.<br>
    Sing praises to him with the harp of ten strings.<br>
    3 Sing to him a new song.<br>
    Play skillfully with a shout of joy.<br>
    4 For the Lord’s word is right.<br>
    All his work is done in faithfulness.<br>
    5 He loves righteousness and justice.<br>
    The earth is full of the loving kindness of the Lord.<br>
    6 By the Lord’s word, the heavens were made:<br>
    all their army by the breath of his mouth.<br>
    7 He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap.<br>
    He lays up the deeps in storehouses.<br>
    8 Let all the earth fear the Lord.<br>
    Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.<br>
    9 For he spoke, and it was done.<br>
    He commanded, and it stood firm.<br>
    10 The Lord brings the counsel of the nations to nothing.<br>
    He makes the thoughts of the peoples to be of no effect.<br>
    11 The counsel of the Lord stands fast forever,<br>
    the thoughts of his heart to all generations.<br>
    12 Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord,<br>
    the people whom he has chosen for his own inheritance.<br>
    13 The Lord looks from heaven.<br>
    He sees all the sons of men.<br>
    14 From the place of his habitation he looks out on all the inhabitants of the earth—<br>
    15 he who fashions all of their hearts;<br>
    and he considers all of their works.<br>
    16 There is no king saved by the multitude of an army.<br>
    A mighty man is not delivered by great strength.<br>
    17 A horse is a vain thing for safety,<br>
    neither does he deliver any by his great power.<br>
    18 Behold, the Lord’s eye is on those who fear him,<br>
    on those who hope in his loving kindness;<br>
    19 to deliver their soul from death,<br>
    to keep them alive in famine.<br>
    20 Our soul has waited for the Lord.<br>
    He is our help and our shield.<br>
    21 For our heart rejoices in him,<br>
    because we have trusted in his holy name.<br>
    22 Let your loving kindness be on us, Lord,<br>
    since we have hoped in you.

  <h4>Psalm 34</h4>
  <p>
    1 I will bless the Lord at all times.<br>
    His praise will always be in my mouth.<br>
    2 My soul shall boast in the Lord.<br>
    The humble shall hear of it and be glad.<br>
    3 Oh magnify the Lord with me.<br>
    Let’s exalt his name together.<br>
    4 I sought the Lord, and he answered me,<br>
    and delivered me from all my fears.<br>
    5 They looked to him, and were radiant.<br>
    Their faces shall never be covered with shame.<br>
    6 This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him,<br>
    and saved him out of all his troubles.<br>
    7 The Lord’s angel encamps around those who fear him,<br>
    and delivers them.<br>
    8 Oh taste and see that the Lord is good.<br>
    Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him.<br>
    9 Oh fear the Lord, you his saints,<br>
    for there is no lack with those who fear him.<br>
    10 The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger,<br>
    but those who seek the Lord shall not lack any good thing.<br>
    11 Come, you children, listen to me.<br>
    I will teach you the fear of the Lord.<br>
    12 Who is someone who desires life,<br>
    and loves many days, that he may see good?<br>
    13 Keep your tongue from evil,<br>
    and your lips from speaking lies.<br>
    14 Depart from evil, and do good.<br>
    Seek peace, and pursue it.<br>
    15 The Lord’s eyes are toward the righteous.<br>
    His ears listen to their cry.<br>
    16 The Lord’s face is against those who do evil,<br>
    to cut off the memory of them from the earth.<br>
    17 The righteous cry, and the Lord hears,<br>
    and delivers them out of all their troubles.<br>
    18 The Lord is near to those who have a broken heart,<br>
    and saves those who have a crushed spirit.<br>
    19 Many are the afflictions of the righteous,<br>
    but the Lord delivers him out of them all.<br>
    20 He protects all of his bones.<br>
    Not one of them is broken.<br>
    21 Evil shall kill the wicked.<br>
    Those who hate the righteous shall be condemned.<br>
    22 The Lord redeems the soul of his servants.<br>
    None of those who take refuge in him shall be condemned.

  <h3>Proverbs</h3>
  <h4>Proverbs 6:20–35</h4>
  <p>
    20 My son, keep your father’s commandment,<br>
    and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching.<br>
    21 Bind them continually on your heart.<br>
    Tie them around your neck.<br>
    22 When you walk, it will lead you.<br>
    When you sleep, it will watch over you.<br>
    When you awake, it will talk with you.<br>
    23 For the commandment is a lamp,<br>
    and the law is light.<br>
    Reproofs of instruction are the way of life,<br>
    24 to keep you from the immoral woman,<br>
    from the flattery of the wayward wife’s tongue.<br>
    25 Don’t lust after her beauty in your heart,<br>
    neither let her captivate you with her eyelids.<br>
    26 For a prostitute reduces you to a piece of bread.<br>
    The adulteress hunts for your precious life.<br>
    27 Can a man scoop fire into his lap,<br>
    and his clothes not be burned?<br>
    28 Or can one walk on hot coals,<br>
    and his feet not be scorched?<br>
    29 So is he who goes in to his neighbor’s wife.<br>
    Whoever touches her will not be unpunished.<br>
    30 Men don’t despise a thief if he steals<br>
    to satisfy himself when he is hungry;<br>
    31 but if he is found, he shall restore seven times.<br>
    He shall give all the wealth of his house.<br>
    32 He who commits adultery with a woman is void of understanding.<br>
    He who does it destroys his own soul.<br>
    33 He will get wounds and dishonor.<br>
    His reproach will not be wiped away.<br>
    34 For jealousy arouses the fury of the husband.<br>
    He won’t spare in the day of vengeance.<br>
    35 He won’t regard any ransom,<br>
    neither will he rest content, though you give many gifts.

  <!-- Sirach 11 -->
  <h3>Sirach</h3>
  <h4>Sirach 11</h4>
  <p>
    1 The wisdom of the humble lifts their heads high,<br>
    and makes them sit among the great.<br>
    2 Don’t praise a man for his good looks,<br>
    and don’t detest a man for his outward appearance.<br>
    3 The bee is small among flying creatures,<br>
    but her fruit is the chief of sweet things.<br>
    4 Don’t boast about your clothing and don’t exalt yourself<br>
    in the day of honor,<br>
    for the works of the Lord are wonderful,<br>
    and his works are hidden among men.<br>
    5 Many kings have sat down upon the ground,<br>
    but one who was never thought of has worn a crown.<br>
    6 Many mighty men have been greatly disgraced,<br>
    and illustrious men have been delivered into other men’s hands.<br>
    7 Don’t blame before you investigate.<br>
    Understand first, and then rebuke.<br>
    8 Don’t answer before you have heard.<br>
    Don’t interrupt in the middle of speech.<br>
    9 Don’t strive in a matter that doesn’t concern you;<br>
    and don’t sit with sinners when they judge.<br>
    10 My son, don’t get involved in many matters;<br>
    for if you meddle much, you will not be unpunished;<br>
    and if you pursue, you will not overtake;<br>
    and you will not escape by fleeing.<br>
    11 There is one who toils, labors, and hurries,<br>
    and is so much the more behind.<br>
    12 Again, there is one who is slow,<br>
    and needs help, lacking in strength,<br>
    who abounds in poverty;<br>
    but the Lord’s eyes looked upon him for good;<br>
    he set him up from his low estate,<br>
    13 and lifted up his head;<br>
    and many marveled at him.<br>
    14 Good things and bad, life and death,<br>
    poverty and riches, are from the Lord.<br>
    15 Wisdom, knowledge, and understanding of the law<br>
    come from the Lord;<br>
    love and the way of good works come from him.<br>
    16 Error and darkness were formed with sinners from the beginning;<br>
    and evil grows old with those who take pride in it.<br>
    17 The Lord’s gift remains with the godly,<br>
    and his favor brings prosperity forever.<br>
    18 There is one who grows rich by his wariness and pinching,<br>
    and this is the portion of his reward:<br>
    19 when he says, “I have found rest,<br>
    and now I will eat of my goods,”<br>
    he doesn’t know how much time will pass<br>
    until he leaves them to others and dies.<br>
    20 Be steadfast in your covenant, and be doing it,<br>
    and grow old in your work.<br>
    21 Don’t marvel at the works of a sinner;<br>
    but trust the Lord, and remain in your labor.<br>
    For it is an easy thing in the sight of the Lord<br>
    to suddenly make a poor man rich.<br>
    22 The blessing of the Lord is in the reward of the godly.<br>
    Suddenly he makes his blessing flourish.<br>
    23 Don’t say, “What use is there of me?<br>
    What further good things can I do?”<br>
    24 Don’t say, “I have enough.<br>
    What harm could happen to me now?”<br>
    25 In the day of prosperity, there is a forgetfulness of affliction;<br>
    and in the day of affliction, there is no more remembrance of prosperity.<br>
    26 For it is an easy thing in the sight of the Lord<br>
    to reward a man on the day of death according to his ways.<br>
    27 The affliction of an hour causes delights to forgetfulness;<br>
    and a man’s deeds will be revealed at the last.<br>
    28 Call no man happy before his death;<br>
    a man will be known in his children.<br>
    29 Don’t bring every man into your house;<br>
    for deceitful men are many.<br>
    30 Like as a decoy partridge in a cage, so is the heart of a proud man;<br>
    and like a spy, he looks for your weakness.<br>
    31 For he lies in wait to turn good into evil.<br>
    He will lay blame on the chosen one.<br>
    32 A spark of fire will burn many coals;<br>
    and a sinner lies in wait for blood.<br>
    33 Take heed of an evildoer, for he contrives wicked things;<br>
    lest he bring on you a perpetual blame.<br>
    34 Receive a stranger into your house, and he will distract you with brawls,<br>
    and estrange you from your own.

    1 Contend, Lord, with those who contend with me.<br>
    Fight against those who fight against me.<br>
    2 Take hold of shield and buckler,<br>
    and stand up for my help.<br>
    3 Brandish the spear and block those who pursue me.<br>
    Tell my soul, “I am your salvation.”<br>
    4 Let those who seek after my soul be disappointed and brought to dishonor.<br>
    Let those who plot my ruin be turned back and confounded.<br>
    5 Let them be as chaff before the wind,<br>
    the Lord’s angel driving them on.<br>
    6 Let their way be dark and slippery,<br>
    the Lord’s angel pursuing them.<br>
    7 For without cause they have hidden their net in a pit for me.<br>
    Without cause they have dug a pit for my soul.<br>
    8 Let destruction come on him unawares.<br>
    Let his net that he has hidden catch himself.<br>
    Let him fall into that destruction.<br>
    9 My soul shall be joyful in the Lord.<br>
    It shall rejoice in his salvation.<br>
    10 All my bones shall say, “Lord, who is like you,<br>
    who delivers the poor from him who is too strong for him;<br>
    yes, the poor and the needy from him who robs him?”<br>
    11 Unrighteous witnesses rise up.<br>
    They ask me about things that I don’t know about.<br>
    12 They reward me evil for good,<br>
    to the bereaving of my soul.<br>
    13 But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth.<br>
    I afflicted my soul with fasting.<br>
    My prayer returned into my own bosom.<br>
    14 I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother.<br>
    I bowed down mourning, as one who mourns his mother.<br>
    15 But in my adversity, they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together.<br>
    The attackers gathered themselves together against me, and I didn’t know it.<br>
    They tore at me and didn’t cease.<br>
    16 Like the profane mockers in feasts,<br>
    they gnashed their teeth at me.<br>
    17 Lord, how long will you look on?<br>
    Rescue my soul from their destruction,<br>
    my precious life from the lions.<br>
    18 I will give you thanks in the great assembly.<br>
    I will praise you among many people.<br>
    19 Don’t let those who are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me;<br>
    neither let those who hate me without a cause wink their eyes.<br>
    20 For they don’t speak peace,<br>
    but they devise deceitful words against those who are quiet in the land.<br>
    21 Yes, they opened their mouth wide against me.<br>
    They said, “Aha! Aha! Our eye has seen it!”<br>
    22 You have seen it, Lord. Don’t keep silent.<br>
    Lord, don’t be far from me.<br>
    23 Wake up! Rise up to defend me, my God!<br>
    My Lord, contend for me!<br>
    24 Vindicate me, Lord my God, according to your righteousness.<br>
    Don’t let them gloat over me.<br>
    25 Don’t let them say in their heart, “Aha! That’s the way we want it!”<br>
    Don’t let them say, “We have swallowed him up!”<br>

    Let them be clothed with shame and dishonor who magnify themselves against me.<br>
    27 Let those who delight in my vindication shout for joy and be glad.<br>
    Yes, let them say continually, “May the Lord be exalted,<br>
    who delights in the peace of his servant!”<br>
    28 My tongue shall talk about your righteousness and about your praise all day long.
  </p>

  <h4>Psalm 36</h4>
  <p>
    1 A revelation is within my heart about the disobedience of the wicked:<br>
    “There is no fear of God before his eyes.”<br>
    2 For he flatters himself in his own eyes,<br>
    too much to detect and hate his sin.<br>
    3 The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit.<br>
    He has ceased to be wise and to do good.<br>
    4 He plots iniquity on his bed.<br>
    He sets himself in a way that is not good.<br>
    He doesn’t abhor evil.<br>
    5 Your loving kindness, Lord, is in the heavens.<br>
    Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.<br>
    6 Your righteousness is like the mountains of God.<br>
    Your judgments are like a great deep.<br>
    Lord, you preserve man and animal.<br>
    7 How precious is your loving kindness, God!<br>
    The children of men take refuge under the shadow of your wings.<br>
    8 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the abundance of your house.<br>
    You will make them drink of the river of your pleasures.<br>
    9 For with you is the spring of life.<br>
    In your light we will see light.<br>
    10 Oh continue your loving kindness to those who know you,<br>
    your righteousness to the upright in heart.<br>
    11 Don’t let the foot of pride come against me.<br>
    Don’t let the hand of the wicked drive me away.<br>
    12 There the workers of iniquity are fallen.<br>
    They are thrust down, and shall not be able to rise.

    1 My son, keep my words.<br>
    Lay up my commandments within you.<br>

    Guard my teaching as the apple of your eye.<br>

  <h4>Sirach 12</h4>
  <p>
    1 If you do good, know to whom you do it;<br>
    so you will be thanked for your good deeds.<br>
    2 Do good to a godly man, and you will be repaid—<br>
    if not by him, yet by the Most High.<br>
    3 There can’t no good come to him who continues to do evil,<br>
    nor to him who doesn’t give alms.<br>
    4 Give to the godly man,<br>
    and don’t help the sinner.<br>
    5 Do good to one who is lowly,<br>
    and don’t give to an ungodly man.<br>
    Keep back his bread, and don’t give it to him,<br>
    lest he overmaster you by it;<br>
    for you would receive twice as much evil<br>
    for all the good you would have done to him.<br>
    6 For the Most High also hates sinners,<br>
    and will repay vengeance to the ungodly.<br>
    7 Give to the good man, and don’t help the sinner.<br>
    8 A friend won’t be known in prosperity.<br>
    An enemy won’t be hidden in adversity.<br>
    9 In a man’s prosperity his enemies are grieved,<br>
    but in his adversity his friend is revealed.<br>
    10 Never trust your enemy,<br>
    for his wickedness is like rust and brass.<br>
    11 Even if he humbles himself, and goes crouching,<br>
    be on your guard, and keep yourself from him.<br>
    You will be to him like one who has polished a mirror,<br>
    and you will know that his rust has not been altogether wiped away.<br>
    12 Don’t set him by you,<br>
    lest he overthrow you and stand in your place.<br>
    Don’t let him sit on your right hand,<br>
    lest he seek your seat,<br>
    and you at the last remember my words,<br>
    and be pricked by my words.<br>
    13 Who will pity a charmer that is bitten by a serpent,<br>
    or any who come near wild beasts?<br>
    14 So is he who goes to a sinner,<br>
    and is defiled with him in his sins.<br>
    15 He will stay with you for a while,<br>
    but if you falter, he won’t stay.<br>
    16 The enemy will speak sweetly with his lips,<br>
    and plan to throw you into a pit.<br>
    The enemy will weep with his eyes,<br>
    but if he finds an opportunity, he will not be satisfied with blood.<br>
    17 If adversity comes on you, you will find him there before you.<br>
    Pretending to help you, he will trip you by the heel.<br>
    18 He will shake his head, clap his hands,<br>
    whisper much, and change his expression.

  <h3>Psalms</h3>

  <h4>Psalm 37</h4>
  <p>
    1 Don’t fret because of evildoers,<br>
    neither be envious against those who work unrighteousness.<br>
    2 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass,<br>
    and wither like the green herb.<br>
    3 Trust in the Lord, and do good.<br>
    Dwell in the land, and enjoy safe pasture.<br>
    4 Also delight yourself in the Lord,<br>
    and he will give you the desires of your heart.<br>
    5 Commit your way to the Lord.<br>
    Trust also in him, and he will do this:<br>
    6 he will make your righteousness shine out like light,<br>
    and your justice as the noon day sun.<br>
    7 Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him.<br>
    Don’t fret because of him who prospers in his way,<br>
    because of the man who makes wicked plots happen.<br>
    8 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath.<br>
    Don’t fret; it leads only to evildoing.<br>
    9 For evildoers shall be cut off,<br>
    but those who wait for the Lord shall inherit the land.<br>
    10 For yet a little while, and the wicked will be no more.<br>
    Yes, though you look for his place, he isn’t there.<br>
    11 But the humble shall inherit the land,<br>
    and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.<br>
    12 The wicked plots against the just,<br>
    and gnashes at him with his teeth.<br>
    13 The Lord will laugh at him,<br>
    for he sees that his day is coming.<br>
    14 The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow,<br>
    to cast down the poor and needy,<br>
    to kill those who are upright on the path.<br>
    15 Their sword shall enter into their own heart.<br>
    Their bows shall be broken.<br>
    16 Better is a little that the righteous has,<br>
    than the abundance of many wicked.<br>
    17 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken,<br>
    but the Lord upholds the righteous.<br>
    18 The Lord knows the days of the perfect.<br>
    Their inheritance shall be forever.<br>
    19 They shall not be disappointed in the time of evil.<br>
    In the days of famine they shall be satisfied.<br>
    20 But the wicked shall perish.<br>
    The enemies of the Lord shall be like the beauty of the fields.<br>
    They will vanish—vanish like smoke.<br>
    21 The wicked borrow, and don’t pay back,<br>
    but the righteous give generously.<br>
    22 For such as are blessed by him shall inherit the land.<br>
    Those who are cursed by him shall be cut off.<br>
    23 A man’s steps are established by the Lord.<br>
    He delights in his way.<br>
    24 Though he stumble, he shall not fall,<br>
    for the Lord holds him up with his hand.<br>
    25 I have been young, and now am old,<br>
    yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken,<br>
    nor his children begging for bread.<br>
    26 All day long he deals graciously, and lends.<br>
    His offspring is blessed.<br>
    27 Depart from evil, and do good.<br>
    Live securely forever.<br>
    28 For the Lord loves justice,<br>
    and doesn’t forsake his saints.<br>
    They are preserved forever,<br>
    but the children of the wicked shall be cut off.<br>
    29 The righteous shall inherit the land,<br>
    and live in it forever.<br>
    30 The mouth of the righteous talks of wisdom.<br>
    His tongue speaks justice.<br>
    31 The law of his God is in his heart.<br>
    None of his steps shall slide.<br>
    32 The wicked watch the righteous,<br>
    and seek to kill him.<br>
    33 The Lord will not leave him in his hand,<br>
    nor condemn him when he is judged.<br>
    34 Wait for the Lord, and keep his way,<br>
    and he will exalt you to inherit the land.<br>
    When the wicked are cut off, you shall see it.<br>
    35 I have seen the wicked in great power,<br>
    spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil.<br>
    36 But he passed away, and behold, he was not.<br>
    Yes, I sought him, but he could not be found.<br>
    37 Mark the perfect man, and see the upright,<br>
    for there is a future for the man of peace.<br>
    38 As for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together.<br>
    The future of the wicked shall be cut off.<br>
    39 But the salvation of the righteous is from the Lord.<br>
    He is their stronghold in the time of trouble.<br>
    40 The Lord helps them, and rescues them.<br>
    He rescues them from the wicked, and saves them,<br>
    because they have taken refuge in him.

  <p>
    6 For at the window of my house,<br>
    I looked out through my lattice.<br>
    7 I saw among the simple ones.<br>
    I discerned among the youths a young man void of understanding,<br>
    8 passing through the street near her corner,<br>
    he went the way to her house,<br>
    9 in the twilight, in the evening of the day,<br>
    in the middle of the night and in the darkness.<br>
    10 Behold, there a woman met him with the attire of a prostitute,<br>
    and with crafty intent.<br>
    11 She is loud and defiant.<br>
    Her feet don’t stay in her house.<br>
    12 Now she is in the streets, now in the squares,<br>
    and lurking at every corner.<br>
    13 So she caught him, and kissed him.<br>
    With an impudent face she said to him:<br>
    14 “Sacrifices of peace offerings are with me.<br>
    Today I have paid my vows.<br>
    15 Therefore I came out to meet you,<br>
    to diligently seek your face,<br>
    and I have found you.<br>
    16 I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry,<br>
    with striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt.<br>
    17 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.<br>
    18 Come, let’s take our fill of loving until the morning.<br>
    Let’s solace ourselves with loving.<br>
    19 For my husband isn’t at home.<br>
    He has gone on a long journey.<br>
    20 He has taken a bag of money with him.<br>
    He will come home at the full moon.”<br>
    21 With persuasive words, she led him astray.<br>
    With the flattering of her lips, she seduced him.<br>
    22 He followed her immediately,<br>
    as an ox goes to the slaughter,<br>
    as a fool stepping into a noose.<br>
    23 Until an arrow strikes through his liver,<br>
    as a bird hurries to the snare,<br>
    and doesn’t know that it will cost his life.<br>
    24 Now therefore, sons, listen to me.<br>
    Pay attention to the words of my mouth.<br>
    25 Don’t let your heart turn to her ways.<br>
    Don’t go astray in her paths,<br>
    26 for she has thrown down many wounded.<br>
    Yes, all her slain are a mighty army.<br>
    27 Her house is the way to Sheol,<br>
    going down to the rooms of death.

  <p>
    1 He who touches pitch will be defiled.<br>
    He who associates with a proud man will become like him.<br>
    2 Don’t carry a burden too heavy for you.<br>
    Don’t associate yourself with one who is mightier and richer than you.<br>
    What fellowship would the earthen pot have with the kettle?<br>
    The kettle will strike, and the pot will be broken.<br>
    3 The rich man does a wrong, and he threatens.<br>
    The poor is wronged, and he must beg.<br>
    4 If you are profitable, he will make merchandise of you.<br>
    If you are in want, he will forsake you.<br>
    5 If you own something, he will live with you.<br>
    He will drain your resources, and he won’t feel sorry for you.<br>
    6 When he needs you, he will deceive you.<br>
    He will smile at you and give you hope.<br>
    He will speak kindly to you and say, “What do you need?”<br>
    7 He will shame you by his feasts,<br>
    until he has made you bare two or three times.<br>
    Afterward, he will mock you.<br>
    Finally, when he sees you, he will forsake you<br>
    and shake his head at you.<br>
    8 Beware that you are not deceived,<br>
    and brought down in your enjoyment.<br>
    9 If you are invited by a mighty man,<br>
    withdraw yourself.<br>
    Then he will invite you all the more.<br>
    10 Don’t press yourself on him, lest you be thrust away;<br>
    but don’t stand far off, lest you be forgotten.<br>
    11 Don’t intend to speak with him as an equal,<br>
    and don’t trust his many words;<br>
    for he will test you with much talk,<br>
    and will examine you in a smiling way.<br>
    12 He who doesn’t keep confidences to himself is unmerciful.<br>
    He won’t spare you from harm, or from binding you as a prisoner.<br>
    13 Keep yourself far from the man who has power to kill,<br>
    and you will have no suspicion of the fear of death.<br>
    If you come to him, don’t commit any fault,<br>
    lest he take away your life.<br>
    Know that you go about among snares,<br>
    and that you walk on the battlements of the city.<br>
    14 As much as possible, get to know your neighbors,<br>
    and consult with the wise.<br>
    15 Let your conversation be with men of understanding,<br>
    and let all your discourse be about the law of the Most High.<br>
    16 Let righteous men be companions at your table.<br>
    Let your glory be in the fear of the Lord.<br>
    17 A work is commended by its resources;<br>
    so he who speaks wisely is wise to the ears of those who will listen.<br>
    18 As a pale is set between two things, so is sin between selling and buying.<br>
    19 Unless a man holds diligently to the fear of the Lord,<br>
    his house will soon be overthrown.

  <h4>Psalm 38</h4>
  <p>
    1 Lord, don’t rebuke me in your wrath,<br>
    neither chasten me in your hot displeasure.<br>
    2 For your arrows have pierced me,<br>
    your hand presses hard on me.<br>
    3 There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation,<br>
    neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin.<br>
    4 For my iniquities have gone over my head.<br>
    As a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me.<br>
    5 My wounds are loathsome and corrupt<br>
    because of my foolishness.<br>
    6 I am in pain and bowed down greatly.<br>
    I go mourning all day long.<br>
    7 For my waist is filled with burning.<br>
    There is no soundness in my flesh.<br>
    8 I am faint and severely bruised.<br>
    I have groaned by reason of the anguish of my heart.<br>
    9 Lord, all my desire is before you.<br>
    My groaning is not hidden from you.<br>
    10 My heart throbs.<br>
    My strength fails me.<br>
    As for the light of my eyes, it has also left me.<br>
    11 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague.<br>
    My kinsmen stand far away.<br>
    12 They also who seek after my life lay snares.<br>
    Those who seek my hurt speak mischievous things,<br>
    and meditate deceits all day long.<br>
    13 But I, as a deaf man, don’t hear.<br>
    I am as a mute man who doesn’t open his mouth.<br>
    14 Yes, I am as a man who doesn’t hear,<br>
    in whose mouth are no reproofs.<br>
    15 For I hope in you, Lord.<br>
    You will answer, Lord my God.<br>
    16 For I said, “Don’t let them gloat over me,<br>
    or exalt themselves over me when my foot slips.”<br>
    17 For I am ready to fall.<br>
    My pain is continually before me.<br>
    18 For I will declare my iniquity.<br>
    I will be sorry for my sin.<br>
    19 But my enemies are vigorous and many.<br>
    Those who hate me without reason are numerous.<br>
    20 They who also render evil for good are adversaries to me,<br>
    because I follow what is good.<br>
    21 Don’t forsake me, Lord.<br>
    My God, don’t be far from me.<br>
    22 Hurry to help me,<br>
    Lord, my salvation.

  <h4>Psalm 39</h4>
  <p>
    1 I said, “I will watch my ways, so that I don’t sin with my tongue.<br>
    I will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before me.”<br>
    2 I was mute with silence.<br>
    I held my peace, even from good.<br>
    My sorrow was stirred.<br>
    3 My heart was hot within me.<br>
    While I meditated, the fire burned.<br>
    I spoke with my tongue:<br>
    4 “Lord, show me my end,<br>
    what is the measure of my days.<br>
    Let me know how frail I am.<br>
    5 Behold, you have made my days hand-widths.<br>
    My lifetime is as nothing before you.<br>
    Surely every man stands as a breath.”<br>
    Selah.<br>
    6 “Surely every man walks like a shadow.<br>
    Surely they busy themselves in vain.<br>
    He heaps up, and doesn’t know who shall gather.<br>
    7 Now, Lord, what do I wait for?<br>
    My hope is in you.<br>
    8 Deliver me from all my transgressions.<br>
    Don’t make me the reproach of the foolish.<br>
    9 I was mute.<br>
    I didn’t open my mouth,<br>
    because you did it.<br>
    10 Remove your scourge away from me.<br>
    I am overcome by the blow of your hand.<br>
    11 When you rebuke and correct man for iniquity,<br>
    you consume his wealth like a moth.<br>
    Surely every man is but a breath.”<br>
    Selah.<br>
    12 “Hear my prayer, Lord, and give ear to my cry.<br>
    Don’t be silent at my tears.<br>
    For I am a stranger with you,<br>
    a foreigner, as all my fathers were.<br>
    13 Oh spare me, that I may recover strength,<br>
    before I go away and exist no more.”

    2 On the top of high places by the way,<br>
    where the paths meet, she stands.<br>
    3 Beside the gates, at the entry of the city,<br>

    10 Receive my instruction rather than silver;<br>
    knowledge rather than choice gold.<br>
    11 For wisdom is better than rubies.<br>
    All the things that may be desired can’t be compared to it.<br>
    12 “I, wisdom, have made prudence my dwelling.<br>
    Find out knowledge and discretion.<br>
    13 The fear of the Lord is to hate evil.<br>
    I hate pride, arrogance, the evil way, and the perverse mouth.<br>
    14 Counsel and sound knowledge are mine.<br>
    I have understanding and power.<br>
    15 By me kings reign,<br>
    and princes decree justice.<br>
    16 By me princes rule,<br>
    nobles, and all the righteous rulers of the earth.<br>
    17 I love those who love me.<br>
    Those who seek me diligently will find me.<br>
    18 With me are riches, honor,<br>
    enduring wealth, and prosperity.<br>
    19 My fruit is better than gold, yes, than fine gold;<br>
    my yield than choice silver.<br>
    20 I walk in the way of righteousness,<br>

    2 Blessed is he whose soul does not condemn him,<br>
    and who has not fallen from his hope.<br>
    3 Riches are not appropriate for a stingy man.<br>
    Why should an envious man make use of money?<br>
    4 He who gathers by depriving himself gathers for others,<br>
    who will revel in his goods.<br>
    5 He who is evil to himself, to whom will he be good?<br>
    He won’t enjoy what he obtains.<br>
    6 There is none worse than he who is grudging to himself.<br>
    This is the repayment of his wickedness.<br>
    7 Even if he does good, he does it in forgetfulness;<br>
    and in the end he shows his wickedness.<br>
    8 The envious man has a wicked eye.<br>
    He turns away his face and despises men.<br>
    9 A covetous man’s eye is not satisfied with his portion.<br>
    Wicked injustice withers his soul.<br>
    10 An evil eye is toward evil,<br>

    You haven’t been shown the covenant of Hades.<br>
    13 Do good to your friend before you die;<br>
    and according to your ability, stretch out your hand and give to him.<br>
    14 Don’t defraud yourself of a good day.<br>
    Don’t let your portion of a good desire pass you by.<br>
    15 Won’t you leave your labors to another,<br>
    and your toils to be divided by lot?<br>
    16 Give, take, and sanctify your soul,<br>
    because there is no seeking of luxuries in the grave.<br>
    17 All flesh grows old like a garment,<br>
    for the covenant from the beginning is, “You shall die the death.”<br>
    18 Like the leaves flourishing on a thick tree,<br>
    some it sheds and some it grows—<br>
    so also is the generation of flesh and blood;<br>
    one comes to an end, and another is born.<br>
    19 Every work rots and falls away,<br>
    and its worker will go with it.<br>
    20 Blessed is the man who meditates on wisdom,<br>
    and who reasons by his understanding.<br>
    21 He who considers her ways in his heart<br>
    will also have understanding in her secrets.<br>
    22 Go after her like a tracker,<br>
    and lie in wait in her ways.<br>
    23 He who peers in at her windows<br>
    will also listen at her doors.<br>
    24 He who lodges close to her house<br>
    will also fasten a peg in her walls.<br>
    25 He will pitch his tent near at hand to her,<br>
    and will lodge in a lodging where good things are.<br>
    26 He will set his children under her shelter,<br>
    and will lodge under her branches.<br>
    27 He will be sheltered by her from the heat,<br>
    and will dwell in her glory.

  <!-- Psalms 40, 41, 42 -->
  <h3>Psalms</h3>

  <h4>Psalm 40</h4>
  <p>
    1 I waited patiently for the Lord.<br>
    He turned to me, and heard my cry.<br>
    2 He brought me up also out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay.<br>
    He set my feet on a rock,<br>
    and gave me a firm place to stand.<br>
    3 He has put a new song in my mouth, even praise to our God.<br>
    Many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the Lord.<br>
    4 Blessed is the man who makes the Lord his trust,<br>
    and doesn’t respect the proud,<br>
    nor such as turn away to lies.<br>
    5 Many, Lord, my God, are the wonderful works which you have done,<br>
    and your thoughts which are toward us.<br>
    They can’t be declared back to you.<br>
    If I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be counted.<br>
    6 Sacrifice and offering you didn’t desire.<br>
    You have opened my ears.<br>
    You have not required burnt offering and sin offering.<br>
    7 Then I said, “Behold, I have come.<br>
    It is written about me in the book in the scroll.<br>
    8 I delight to do your will, my God.<br>
    Yes, your law is within my heart.”<br>
    9 I have proclaimed glad news of righteousness in the great assembly.<br>
    Behold, I will not seal my lips, Lord, you know.<br>
    10 I have not hidden your righteousness within my heart.<br>
    I have declared your faithfulness and your salvation.<br>
    I have not concealed your loving kindness and your truth from the great assembly.<br>
    11 Don’t withhold your tender mercies from me, Lord.<br>
    Let your loving kindness and your truth continually preserve me.<br>
    12 For innumerable evils have surrounded me.<br>
    My iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up.<br>
    They are more than the hairs of my head.<br>
    My heart has failed me.<br>
    13 Be pleased, Lord, to deliver me.<br>
    Hurry to help me, Lord.<br>
    14 Let them be disappointed and confounded together who seek after my soul to destroy it.<br>
    Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt.<br>
    15 Let them be desolate by reason of their shame that tell me, “Aha! Aha!”<br>
    16 Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you.<br>
    Let such as love your salvation say continually, “Let the Lord be exalted!”<br>
    17 But I am poor and needy.<br>
    May the Lord think about me.<br>
    You are my help and my deliverer.<br>
    Don’t delay, my God.
  </p>

  <h4>Psalm 41</h4>
  <p>
    1 Blessed is he who considers the poor.<br>
    The Lord will deliver him in the day of evil.<br>
    2 The Lord will preserve him, and keep him alive.<br>
    He shall be blessed on the earth,<br>
    and he will not surrender him to the will of his enemies.<br>
    3 The Lord will sustain him on his sickbed,<br>
    and restore him from his bed of illness.<br>
    4 I said, “Lord, have mercy on me!<br>
    Heal me, for I have sinned against you.”<br>
    5 My enemies speak evil against me:<br>
    “When will he die, and his name perish?”<br>
    6 If he comes to see me, he speaks falsehood.<br>
    His heart gathers iniquity to itself.<br>
    When he goes abroad, he tells it.<br>
    7 All who hate me whisper together against me.<br>
    They imagine the worst for me.<br>
    8 “An evil disease,” they say, “has afflicted him.<br>
    Now that he lies he shall rise up no more.”<br>
    9 Yes, my own familiar friend, in whom I trusted,<br>
    who ate bread with me,<br>
    has lifted up his heel against me.<br>
    10 But you, Lord, have mercy on me, and raise me up,<br>
    that I may repay them.<br>
    11 By this I know that you delight in me,<br>
    because my enemy doesn’t triumph over me.<br>
    12 As for me, you uphold me in my integrity,<br>
    and set me in your presence forever.<br>
    13 Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,<br>
    from everlasting and to everlasting!<br>
    Amen and amen.
  </p>

  <h4>Psalm 42</h4>
  <p>
    1 As the deer pants for the water brooks,<br>
    so my soul pants after you, God.<br>
    2 My soul thirsts for God, for the living God.<br>
    When shall I come and appear before God?<br>
    3 My tears have been my food day and night,<br>
    while they continually ask me, “Where is your God?”<br>
    4 These things I remember, and pour out my soul within me,<br>
    how I used to go with the crowd, and led them to God’s house,<br>
    with the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping a holy day.<br>
    5 Why are you in despair, my soul?<br>
    Why are you disturbed within me?<br>
    Hope in God!<br>
    For I shall still praise him for the saving help of his presence.<br>
    6 My God, my soul is in despair within me.<br>
    Therefore I remember you from the land of the Jordan,<br>
    the heights of Hermon, from the hill Mizar.<br>
    7 Deep calls to deep at the noise of your waterfalls.<br>
    All your waves and your billows have swept over me.<br>
    8 The Lord will command his loving kindness in the daytime.<br>
    In the night his song shall be with me:<br>
    a prayer to the God of my life.<br>
    9 I will ask God, my rock, “Why have you forgotten me?<br>
    Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?”<br>
    10 As with a sword in my bones, my adversaries reproach me,<br>
    while they continually ask me, “Where is your God?”<br>
    11 Why are you in despair, my soul?<br>
    Why are you disturbed within me?<br>
    Hope in God!<br>
    For I shall still praise him,<br>
    the saving help of my countenance, and my God.

  <p>
    22 “The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his work,<br>
    before his deeds of old.<br>
    23 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning,<br>
    before the earth existed.<br>
    24 When there were no depths, I was born,<br>
    when there were no springs abounding with water.<br>
    25 Before the mountains were settled in place,<br>
    before the hills, I was born;<br>
    26 while as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields,<br>
    nor the beginning of the dust of the world.<br>
    27 When he established the heavens, I was there.<br>
    When he set a circle on the surface of the deep,<br>
    28 when he established the clouds above,<br>
    when the springs of the deep became strong,<br>
    29 when he set a boundary for the sea,<br>
    that the waters should not violate his commandment,<br>
    when he marked out the foundations of the earth,<br>
    30 then I was the craftsman by his side.<br>
    I was a delight day by day,<br>
    always rejoicing before him,<br>
    31 rejoicing in his whole world.<br>
    My delight was with the sons of men.<br>
    32 “Now therefore, my sons, listen to me,<br>
    for blessed are those who keep my ways.<br>
    33 Hear instruction, and be wise.<br>
    Don’t refuse it.<br>
    34 Blessed is the man who hears me,<br>
    watching daily at my gates,<br>
    waiting at my door posts.<br>
    35 For whoever finds me, finds life,<br>
    and will obtain favor from the Lord.<br>
    36 But he who sins against me wrongs his own soul.<br>
    All those who hate me love death.”

    1 He who fears the Lord will do this;<br>
    and he who has understanding will find his good pleasure.<br>
    2 She will meet him like a mother,<br>
    and will receive him like a wife married in her virginity.<br>
    3 She will feed him with the bread of understanding,<br>
    and give him the water of wisdom to drink.<br>
    4 He will be stayed on her and will not be moved.<br>
    He will rely on her and will not be confounded.<br>
    5 She will exalt him above his neighbors.<br>
    She will open his mouth in the midst of the congregation.<br>
    6 He will find gladness and a crown of rejoicing.<br>
    He will inherit an everlasting name.<br>
    7 Foolish men will not attain to her.<br>
    Sinners will not see her.<br>
    8 For she is far from pride.<br>
    Deceitful men can’t remember her.<br>
    9 Praise is not becoming in the mouth of a sinner,<br>
    for it wasn’t sent to him from the Lord.<br>
    10 For praise will be spoken in wisdom,<br>
    and the Lord will prosper it.<br>
    11 Don’t say, “It is through the Lord that I fell away,”<br>
    for you shall not do the things that he hates.<br>
    12 Don’t say, “He has caused me to err,”<br>
    for he has no need of a sinful man.<br>
    13 The Lord hates every abomination.<br>
    They who fear him love it not.<br>
    14 He himself made man from the beginning,<br>
    and left him in the hand of his own counsel.<br>
    15 If you will, you can keep the commandments;<br>
    and to do faithfully what is acceptable is within your power.<br>
    16 He has set fire and water before you.<br>
    You will stretch out your hand for whichever you choose.<br>
    17 Life and death are before man.<br>
    Whichever he likes will be given to him.<br>
    18 For the wisdom of the Lord is great.<br>
    He is mighty in power, and sees all things.<br>
    19 His eyes are upon those who fear him.<br>
    He knows every work of man.<br>
    20 He has commanded no man to do wickedly.<br>
    He has given no man license to sin.

    Oh, deliver me from deceitful and wicked men.<br>
    2 For you are the God of my strength. Why have you rejected me?<br>

    3 Oh, send out your light and your truth. Let them lead me.<br>

  <h4>Psalm 44</h4>
  <p>
    1 We have heard with our ears, God;<br>
    our fathers have told us what work you did in their days,<br>
    in the days of old.<br>
    2 You drove out the nations with your hand,<br>
    but you planted them.<br>
    You afflicted the peoples,<br>
    but you spread them abroad.<br>
    3 For they didn’t get the land in possession by their own sword,<br>
    neither did their own arm save them,<br>
    but your right hand, your arm, and the light of your face,<br>
    because you were favorable to them.<br>
    4 You are my King, God.<br>
    Command victories for Jacob!<br>
    5 Through you, we will push down our adversaries.<br>
    Through your name, we will trample those who rise up against us.<br>
    6 For I will not trust in my bow,<br>
    neither shall my sword save me.<br>
    7 But you have saved us from our adversaries,<br>
    and have shamed those who hate us.<br>
    8 In God we have made our boast all day long.<br>
    We will give thanks to your name forever.<br>
    Selah.<br>
    9 But now you rejected us, and brought us to dishonor,<br>
    and don’t go out with our armies.<br>
    10 You make us turn back from the adversary.<br>
    Those who hate us take plunder for themselves.<br>
    11 You have made us like sheep for food,<br>
    and have scattered us among the nations.<br>
    12 You sell your people for nothing,<br>
    and have gained nothing from their sale.<br>
    13 You make us a reproach to our neighbors,<br>
    a scoffing and a derision to those who are around us.<br>
    14 You make us a byword among the nations,<br>
    a shaking of the head among the peoples.<br>
    15 All day long my dishonor is before me,<br>
    and shame covers my face,<br>
    16 at the taunt of one who reproaches and verbally abuses,<br>
    because of the enemy and the avenger.<br>
    17 All this has come on us,<br>
    yet we have not forgotten you.<br>
    We have not been false to your covenant.<br>
    18 Our heart has not turned back,<br>
    neither have our steps strayed from your path,<br>
    19 though you have crushed us in the haunt of jackals,<br>
    and covered us with the shadow of death.<br>
    20 If we have forgotten the name of our God,<br>
    or spread out our hands to a strange god,<br>
    21 won’t God search this out?<br>
    For he knows the secrets of the heart.<br>
    22 Yes, for your sake we are killed all day long.<br>
    We are regarded as sheep for the slaughter.<br>
    23 Wake up! Why do you sleep, Lord?<br>
    Arise! Don’t reject us forever.<br>
    24 Why do you hide your face,<br>
    and forget our affliction and our oppression?<br>
    25 For our soul is bowed down to the dust.<br>
    Our body clings to the earth.<br>
    26 Rise up to help us.<br>
    Redeem us for your loving kindness’ sake.

    My tongue is like the pen of a skillful writer.<br>
    2 You are the most excellent of the sons of men.<br>
    Grace has anointed your lips,<br>
    therefore God has blessed you forever.<br>
    3 Strap your sword on your thigh, mighty one,<br>
    in your splendor and your majesty.<br>
    4 In your majesty ride on victoriously on behalf of truth, humility, and righteousness.<br>
    Let your right hand display awesome deeds.<br>
    5 Your arrows are sharp.<br>
    The nations fall under you,<br>
    with arrows in the heart of the king’s enemies.<br>
    6 Your throne, God, is forever and ever.<br>
    A scepter of equity is the scepter of your kingdom.<br>
    7 You have loved righteousness, and hated wickedness.<br>
    Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.<br>
    8 All your garments smell like myrrh, aloes, and cassia.<br>
    Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made you glad.<br>
    9 Kings’ daughters are among your honorable women.<br>
    At your right hand the queen stands in gold of Ophir.<br>
    10 Listen, daughter, consider, and turn your ear.<br>
    Forget your own people, and also your father’s house.<br>
    11 So the king will desire your beauty.<br>
    Honor him, for he is your lord.<br>
    12 The daughter of Tyre comes with a gift.<br>
    The rich among the people entreat your favor.<br>
    13 The princess inside is all glorious.<br>
    Her clothing is interwoven with gold.<br>
    14 She shall be led to the king in embroidered work.<br>
    The virgins, her companions who follow her, shall be brought to you.<br>
    15 With gladness and rejoicing they shall be led.<br>
    They shall enter into the king’s palace.<br>
    16 Your sons will take the place of your fathers.<br>
    You shall make them princes in all the earth.<br>
    17 I will make your name to be remembered in all generations.<br>
    Therefore the peoples shall give you thanks forever and ever.

    Walk in the way of understanding.”<br>

    1 Don’t desire a multitude of unprofitable children,<br>
    neither delight in ungodly sons.<br>
    2 Even though they multiply, don’t delight in them,<br>
    unless the fear of the Lord is in them.<br>
    3 Don’t trust in their life,<br>
    and don’t rely on their multitude;<br>

    4 For one who has understanding will populate a city,<br>
    but a race of wicked men will be made desolate.<br>
    5 My eyes have seen many things.<br>
    My ear has heard stronger things than these.<br>
    6 In the congregation of sinners, a fire will be kindled.<br>
    In a disobedient nation, wrath is kindled.<br>
    7 He was not pacified toward the giants of old,<br>
    who revolted in their might.<br>
    8 He didn’t spare Lot’s neighbors,<br>
    whom he abhorred for their pride.<br>
    9 He didn’t pity the people of perdition,<br>
    who were taken away in their sins.<br>
    10 In like manner, he didn’t pity the six hundred thousand footmen<br>
    who were gathered together in the hardness of their hearts.<br>
    11 Even if there is only one stiff-necked person,<br>
    it will be a wonder if he remains unpunished;<br>
    for mercy and wrath are with him;<br>
    he is mighty to forgive, and he pours out wrath.<br>
    12 As his mercy is great, so is his correction also.<br>
    He judges a man according to his works.<br>
    13 The sinner will not escape with plunder.<br>
    The perseverance of the godly will not be frustrated.<br>
    14 He will make room for every work of mercy.<br>
    Each man will receive according to his works.<br>
    15 The Lord hardened Pharaoh so that he wouldn’t know him,<br>
    that his works might be widely known throughout the earth.<br>
    16 His mercy is revealed to every creature;<br>
    and he has separated his light from the darkness with a adamant.<br>
    17 Don’t say, “I will hide myself from the Lord.<br>
    Who will remember me from on high?<br>
    I will not be known among so many people;<br>
    for what is my soul in such an immense creation?”<br>
    18 Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens,<br>
    the deep, and the earth will be shaken when he visits.<br>
    19 The mountains also and foundations of the earth will tremble with trembling<br>
    when he looks on them.<br>
    20 No heart can think about these things worthily.<br>
    Who will consider his ways?<br>
    21 There is a storm that no man sees.<br>
    Most of his works are hidden.<br>
    22 Who will declare the works of his righteousness?<br>
    Or who will endure them?<br>
    For his covenant is far off.<br>
    It is the trial of all things.<br>
    23 He who lacks understanding thinks about these things vainly.<br>
    A senseless and erring man thinks foolishly.<br>
    24 My son, listen to me, and learn knowledge.<br>
    Heed my words in your heart.<br>
    25 I will show forth discipline in balance,<br>
    and declare knowledge exactly.<br>
    26 The works of the Lord are done in judgment from the beginning.<br>
    From their institution, he measured them.<br>
    27 He set his works in order forever.<br>
    Their beginning and their generations are by their seasons.<br>
    They have not hunger nor labor,<br>
    and they cease not from their works.<br>
    28 No one crowds his neighbor.<br>
    They will never disobey his word.<br>
    29 After this the Lord looked and filled them with his blessing.<br>
    30 Their ways are strong to their good.<br>
    Each covers the face of the earth;<br>

    what desolations he has made in the earth.<br>
    9 He makes wars cease to the end of the earth.<br>
    He breaks the bow, and shatters the spear.<br>
    He burns the chariots in the fire.<br>
    10 “Be still, and know that I am God.<br>
    I will be exalted among the nations.<br>
    I will be exalted in the earth.”<br>

  <p>
    1 Oh clap your hands, all you nations.<br>
    Shout to God with the voice of triumph!<br>
    2 For the Lord Most High is awesome.<br>
    He is a great King over all the earth.<br>
    3 He subdues nations under us,<br>
    and peoples under our feet.<br>
    4 He chooses our inheritance for us,<br>
    the glory of Jacob whom he loved.<br>

    5 God has gone up with a shout,<br>
    the Lord with the sound of a trumpet.<br>
    6 Sing praise to God, sing praises.<br>
    Sing praises to our King, sing praises.<br>
    7 For God is the King of all the earth.<br>
    Sing praises with understanding.<br>
    8 God reigns over the nations.<br>
    God sits on his holy throne.<br>
    9 The princes of the peoples are gathered together,<br>
    the people of the God of Abraham.<br>
    For the shields of the earth belong to God.<br>
    He is greatly exalted!

  <h4>Psalm 48</h4>
  <p>
    1 Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised,<br>
    in the city of our God, in his holy mountain.<br>
    2 Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth,<br>
    is Mount Zion, on the north sides,<br>
    the city of the great King.<br>
    3 God has shown himself in her citadels as a refuge.<br>
    4 For, behold, the kings assembled themselves.<br>
    They passed by together.<br>
    5 They saw it, then they were amazed.<br>
    They were dismayed.<br>
    They hurried away.<br>
    6 Trembling took hold of them there,<br>
    pain as of a woman in travail.<br>
    7 With the east wind, you break the ships of Tarshish.<br>
    8 As we have heard, so we have seen,<br>
    in the city of the Lord of Armies, in the city of our God.<br>
    God will establish it forever.<br>
    Selah.<br>
    9 We have thought about your loving kindness, God,<br>
    in the middle of your temple.<br>
    10 As is your name, God,<br>
    so is your praise to the ends of the earth.<br>
    Your right hand is full of righteousness.<br>
    11 Let Mount Zion be glad!<br>
    Let the daughters of Judah rejoice because of your judgments.<br>
    12 Walk about Zion, and go around her.<br>
    Number its towers.<br>
    13 Notice her bulwarks.<br>
    Consider her palaces,<br>
    that you may tell it to the next generation.<br>
    14 For this God is our God forever and ever.<br>
    He will be our guide even to death.

  <h4>Proverbs 10:1–16</h4>
  <p>
    1 The proverbs of Solomon.<br>
    A wise son makes a glad father;<br>
    but a foolish son brings grief to his mother.<br>
    2 Treasures of wickedness profit nothing,<br>
    but righteousness delivers from death.<br>
    3 The Lord will not allow the soul of the righteous to go hungry,<br>
    but he thrusts away the desire of the wicked.<br>
    4 He becomes poor who works with a lazy hand,<br>
    but the hand of the diligent brings wealth.<br>
    5 He who gathers in summer is a wise son,<br>
    but he who sleeps during the harvest is a son who causes shame.<br>
    6 Blessings are on the head of the righteous,<br>
    but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.<br>
    7 The memory of the righteous is blessed,<br>
    but the name of the wicked will rot.<br>
    8 The wise in heart accept commandments,<br>
    but a chattering fool will fall.<br>
    9 He who walks blamelessly walks surely,<br>
    but he who perverts his ways will be found out.<br>
    10 One winking with the eye causes sorrow,<br>
    but a chattering fool will fall.<br>
    11 The mouth of the righteous is a spring of life,<br>
    but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.<br>
    12 Hatred stirs up strife,<br>
    but love covers all wrongs.<br>
    13 Wisdom is found on the lips of him who has discernment,<br>
    but a rod is for the back of him who is void of understanding.<br>
    14 Wise men lay up knowledge,<br>
    but the mouth of the foolish is near ruin.<br>
    15 The rich man’s wealth is his strong city.<br>
    The destruction of the poor is their poverty.<br>
    16 The labor of the righteous leads to life.<br>
    The increase of the wicked leads to sin.

  <h3>Sirach</h3>
  <h4>Sirach 17</h4>
  <p>
    1 The Lord created man out of earth,<br>
    and turned him back to it again.<br>
    2 He gave them days by number and a set time,<br>
    and gave them authority over the things that are on it.<br>
    3 He endowed them with strength proper to them,<br>
    and made them according to his own image.<br>
    4 He put the fear of man upon all flesh,<br>
    and gave him to have dominion over animals and birds.<br>
    5 They received the use of the five operations of the Lord;<br>
    as sixth he endowed them with understanding,<br>
    and as seventh, speech—an interpreter of the thoughts of their heart.<br>
    6 He filled them with knowledge and understanding,<br>
    and showed them good and evil.<br>
    7 He set his eye upon their hearts,<br>
    that he might show them the majesty of his works.<br>
    8 They will praise his holy name,<br>
    that they may declare the magnificence of his works.<br>
    9 He added to them knowledge,<br>
    and gave them a law of life for a heritage.<br>
    10 He made an everlasting covenant with them,<br>
    and showed them his decrees.<br>
    11 Their eyes saw the majesty of his glory.<br>
    Their ears heard his glorious voice.<br>
    12 He said to them, “Beware of all unrighteousness.”<br>
    Then he gave each man commandment concerning his neighbor.<br>
    13 Their ways are always before him.<br>
    They will not be hidden from his eyes.<br>
    14 He appointed a ruler for every nation,<br>
    but Israel is the Lord’s portion.<br>
    15 All their works are as clear as the sun before him.<br>
    His eyes are continually on their ways.<br>
    16 Their iniquities are not hidden from him.<br>
    All their sins are before the Lord.<br>
    17 His mercy is as great as his majesty.<br>
    He judges man according to his works.<br>
    18 The sinner will not escape with plunder;<br>
    the perseverance of him who trusts in the Lord will not be frustrated.<br>
    19 All works of mercy are as a sign of love.<br>
    20 Man’s almsgiving is as a signet with him,<br>
    and he will keep the good deeds of man as the apple of the eye,<br>
    and give repayment to their sons and daughters.<br>
    21 Afterward he will rise up and repay them.<br>
    He will bring their recompense on their heads.<br>
    22 However, to those who repent he grants a return.<br>
    He comforts those who are losing hope.<br>
    23 Return to the Lord, and forsake your sins.<br>
    Make your prayer before his face, and offend less.<br>
    24 Turn again to the Most High, and turn away from iniquity.<br>
    Greatly hate the abominable thing.<br>
    25 Who will give praise to the Most High in the grave,<br>
    instead of those who are alive and return thanks?<br>
    26 Thanksgiving perishes from the dead, as from one who doesn’t exist.<br>
    He who is alive and well will praise the Lord.<br>
    27 How great is the loving kindness of the Lord, and his mercy to those who turn to him!<br>
    28 For all things can’t be in men,<br>
    because the son of man is not immortal.<br>
    29 What is brighter than the sun? Yet it fades.<br>
    Flesh and blood will devise evil.<br>
    30 He looks upon the power of the height of heaven,<br>
    and all men are earth and ashes.

  <h3>Psalms</h3>

  <h4>Psalm 49</h4>
  <p>
    1 Hear this, all you peoples.<br>
    Listen, all you inhabitants of the world,<br>
    2 both low and high,<br>
    rich and poor together.<br>
    3 My mouth will speak words of wisdom.<br>
    My heart will utter understanding.<br>
    4 I will incline my ear to a proverb.<br>
    I will open my riddle on the harp.<br>
    5 Why should I fear in the days of evil,<br>
    when iniquity at my heels surrounds me?<br>
    6 Those who trust in their wealth,<br>
    and boast in the multitude of their riches—<br>
    7 none of them can by any means redeem his brother,<br>
    nor give God a ransom for him.<br>
    8 For the redemption of their life is costly,<br>
    no payment is ever enough,<br>
    9 that he should live on forever,<br>
    that he should not see corruption.<br>
    10 For he sees that wise men die;<br>
    likewise the fool and the senseless perish,<br>
    and leave their wealth to others.<br>
    11 Their inward thought is that their houses will endure forever,<br>
    and their dwelling places to all generations.<br>
    They name their lands after themselves.<br>
    12 But man, despite his riches, doesn’t endure.<br>
    He is like the animals that perish.<br>
    13 This is the destiny of those who are foolish,<br>
    and of those who approve their sayings.<br>
    Selah.<br>
    14 They are appointed as a flock for Sheol.<br>
    Death shall be their shepherd.<br>
    The upright shall have dominion over them in the morning.<br>
    Their beauty shall decay in Sheol,<br>
    far from their mansion.<br>
    15 But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol,<br>
    for he will receive me.<br>
    Selah.<br>
    16 Don’t be afraid when a man is made rich,<br>
    when the glory of his house is increased;<br>
    17 for when he dies he will carry nothing away.<br>
    His glory won’t descend after him.<br>
    18 Though while he lived he blessed his soul—<br>
    and men praise you when you do well for yourself—<br>
    19 he shall go to the generation of his fathers.<br>
    They shall never see the light.<br>
    20 A man who has riches without understanding,<br>
    is like the animals that perish.

  <h4>Psalm 50</h4>
  <p>
    1 The Mighty One, God, the Lord, speaks,<br>
    and calls the earth from sunrise to sunset.<br>
    2 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty,<br>
    God shines out.<br>
    3 Our God comes, and does not keep silent.<br>
    A fire devours before him.<br>
    It is very stormy around him.<br>
    4 He calls to the heavens above,<br>
    to the earth, that he may judge his people:<br>
    5 “Gather my saints together to me,<br>
    those who have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.”<br>
    6 The heavens shall declare his righteousness,<br>
    for God himself is judge.<br>
    Selah.<br>
    7 “Hear, my people, and I will speak;<br>
    Israel, and I will testify against you.<br>
    I am God, your God.<br>
    8 I don’t rebuke you for your sacrifices.<br>
    Your burnt offerings are continually before me.<br>
    9 I have no need for a bull from your stall,<br>
    nor male goats from your pens.<br>
    10 For every animal of the forest is mine,<br>
    and the livestock on a thousand hills.<br>
    11 I know all the birds of the mountains.<br>
    The wild animals of the field are mine.<br>
    12 If I were hungry, I would not tell you,<br>
    for the world is mine, and all that is in it.<br>
    13 Will I eat the meat of bulls,<br>
    or drink the blood of goats?<br>
    14 Offer to God the sacrifice of thanksgiving.<br>
    Pay your vows to the Most High.<br>
    15 Call on me in the day of trouble.<br>
    I will deliver you, and you will honor me.”<br>
    16 But to the wicked God says,<br>
    “What right do you have to declare my statutes,<br>
    that you have taken my covenant on your lips,<br>
    17 since you hate instruction,<br>
    and throw my words behind you?<br>
    18 When you saw a thief, you consented with him,<br>
    and have participated with adulterers.<br>
    19 You give your mouth to evil.<br>
    You harness your tongue for deceit.<br>
    20 You sit and speak against your brother.<br>
    You slander your own mother’s son.<br>
    21 You have done these things, and I kept silent.<br>
    You thought that I was just like you.<br>
    I will rebuke you, and accuse you in front of your eyes.<br>
    22 “Now consider this, you who forget God,<br>
    lest I tear you into pieces, and there be no one to deliver.<br>
    23 Whoever offers the sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifies me,<br>
    and prepares his way so that I will show God’s salvation to him.”

  <h4>Proverbs 10:17–32</h4>
  <p>
    17 He is in the way of life who heeds correction,<br>
    but he who forsakes reproof leads others astray.<br>
    18 He who hides hatred has lying lips.<br>
    He who utters a slander is a fool.<br>
    19 In the multitude of words there is no lack of disobedience,<br>
    but he who restrains his lips does wisely.<br>
    20 The tongue of the righteous is like choice silver.<br>
    The heart of the wicked is of little worth.<br>
    21 The lips of the righteous feed many,<br>
    but the foolish die for lack of understanding.<br>
    22 The Lord’s blessing brings wealth,<br>
    and he adds no trouble to it.<br>
    23 It is a fool’s pleasure to do wickedness,<br>
    but wisdom is a man of understanding’s pleasure.<br>
    24 What the wicked fear, will overtake them,<br>
    but the desire of the righteous will be granted.<br>
    25 When the whirlwind passes, the wicked is no more;<br>
    but the righteous stand firm forever.<br>
    26 As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes,<br>
    so is the sluggard to those who send him.<br>
    27 The fear of the Lord prolongs days,<br>
    but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.<br>
    28 The prospect of the righteous is joy,<br>
    but the hope of the wicked will perish.<br>
    29 The way of the Lord is a stronghold to the upright,<br>
    but it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity.<br>
    30 The righteous will never be removed,<br>
    but the wicked will not dwell in the land.<br>
    31 The mouth of the righteous produces wisdom,<br>
    but the perverse tongue will be cut off.<br>
    32 The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable,<br>
    but the mouth of the wicked is perverse.

  <p>
    1 He who lives forever created all things in common.<br>
    2 The Lord alone is righteous,<br>
    and there is no other beside him;<br>
    3 who governs the world with the palm of his hand,<br>
    and all things obey his will;<br>
    for he is King of all by his power,<br>
    separating out holy things among them from profane.<br>
    4 To whom has he given power to declare his works?<br>
    Who will trace out his majestic deeds?<br>
    5 Who will number the strength of his majesty?<br>
    Who will also tell out his mercies?<br>
    6 As for the wondrous works of the Lord, it is impossible to make them all known.<br>
    7 When a man has finished, then he is just beginning,<br>
    and when he stops, he will be in need.<br>
    8 What is man? To what purpose does he serve?<br>
    What is his good, and what is his evil?<br>
    9 The number of man’s days at the most are a hundred years.<br>
    10 As a drop of water from the sea, and a pebble from the sand,<br>
    so are a few years in the day of eternity.<br>
    11 Therefore the Lord was patient with them,<br>
    and poured out his mercy on them.<br>
    12 He saw and perceived their end, that it is evil;<br>
    therefore he multiplied his forgiveness.<br>
    13 The mercy of man is for his neighbor,<br>
    but the mercy of the Lord is for all flesh,<br>
    reproving, disciplining, teaching,<br>
    and bringing again as a shepherd does his flock.<br>
    14 He has mercy on those who accept discipline,<br>
    and who diligently seek after his judgments.<br>
    15 My son, to your good deeds don’t add reproach;<br>
    and don’t give a distressed heart with your gifts.<br>
    16 Doesn’t dew relieve the scorching heat?<br>
    So a word is better than a gift.<br>
    17 Behold, isn’t a word better than a gift?<br>
    Both are with a gracious man.<br>
    18 A fool is ungracious and abusive,<br>
    and the gift of a grudging man makes the eyes dim.<br>
    19 Learn before you speak.<br>
    Take care of your health before you get sick.<br>
    20 Examine yourself before judgment,<br>
    and in the day of visitation you will find forgiveness.<br>
    21 Humble yourself before you get sick,<br>
    and in the time of sins show repentance.<br>
    22 Let nothing hinder you from paying a vow in due time;<br>
    and don’t wait until death to be justified.<br>
    23 Before you make a vow, prepare yourself.<br>
    Don’t be like a man who tempts the Lord.<br>
    24 Think about his wrath on the day of death,<br>
    and remember the end of wrath when he turns away his face.<br>
    25 In the time of plenty, remember the time of hunger.<br>
    In the days of wealth, think about poverty and need.<br>
    26 From morning until evening, circumstances change;<br>
    and all things are speedy before the Lord.<br>
    27 A wise man will fear in everything.<br>
    In the days of sinning he will beware of offense,<br>
    but a fool will not observe times.<br>
    28 Every man of understanding knows wisdom,<br>
    and he will give thanks to him who found her.<br>
    29 Those who were of understanding in sayings also became wise themselves,<br>
    and poured out apt proverbs.<br>
    30 Don’t go after your desires.<br>
    Restrain your appetites.<br>
    31 If you give fully to your soul the satisfaction of your lust,<br>
    it will make you the laughingstock of your enemies.<br>
    32 Don’t make merry in great luxury;<br>
    lest you become needy by its expense.<br>
    33 Don’t become a beggar by feasting on borrowed money<br>
    when you have nothing in your purse.

    1 Have mercy on me, God, according to your loving kindness.<br>
    According to the multitude of your tender mercies, blot out my transgressions.<br>
    2 Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity.<br>
    Cleanse me from my sin.<br>
    3 For I know my transgressions.<br>
    My sin is constantly before me.<br>
    4 Against you, and you only, I have sinned,<br>
    and done that which is evil in your sight,<br>
    so you may be proved right when you speak,<br>
    and justified when you judge.<br>
    5 Behold, I was born in iniquity.<br>
    My mother conceived me in sin.<br>
    6 Behold, you desire truth in the inward parts.<br>
    You teach me wisdom in the inmost place.<br>
    7 Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean.<br>
    Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.<br>
    8 Let me hear joy and gladness,<br>
    that the bones which you have broken may rejoice.<br>
    9 Hide your face from my sins,<br>
    and blot out all of my iniquities.<br>
    10 Create in me a clean heart, O God.<br>
    Renew a right spirit within me.<br>
    11 Don’t throw me from your presence,<br>
    and don’t take your Holy Spirit from me.<br>
    12 Restore to me the joy of your salvation.<br>
    Uphold me with a willing spirit.<br>
    13 Then I will teach transgressors your ways.<br>
    Sinners shall be converted to you.<br>
    14 Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, O God, the God of my salvation.<br>
    My tongue shall sing aloud of your righteousness.<br>
    15 Lord, open my lips.<br>
    My mouth shall declare your praise.<br>
    16 For you don’t delight in sacrifice, or else I would give it.<br>
    You have no pleasure in burnt offering.<br>
    17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit.<br>
    O God, you will not despise a broken and contrite heart.<br>
    18 Do well in your good pleasure to Zion.<br>
    Build the walls of Jerusalem.<br>
    19 Then you will delight in the sacrifices of righteousness,<br>
    in burnt offerings and in whole burnt offerings.<br>
    Then they will offer bulls on your altar.

  <p>
    1 Why do you boast of mischief, mighty man?<br>
    God’s loving kindness endures continually.<br>
    2 Your tongue plots destruction,<br>
    like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.<br>
    3 You love evil more than good,<br>
    lying rather than speaking the truth.<br>
    Selah.<br>
    4 You love all devouring words,<br>
    you deceitful tongue.<br>
    5 God will likewise destroy you forever.<br>
    He will take you up and pluck you out of your tent,<br>
    and root you out of the land of the living.<br>
    Selah.<br>
    6 The righteous also will see it, and fear,<br>
    and laugh at him, saying,<br>
    7 “Behold, this is the man who didn’t make God his strength,<br>
    but trusted in the abundance of his riches,<br>
    and strengthened himself in his wickedness.”<br>
    8 But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in God’s house.<br>
    I trust in God’s loving kindness forever and ever.<br>
    9 I will give you thanks forever, because you have done it.<br>
    I will hope in your name, for it is good,<br>
    in the presence of your saints.

  <h4>Psalm 53</h4>
  <p>
    1 The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.”<br>
    They are corrupt, and have done abominable iniquity.<br>
    There is no one who does good.<br>
    2 God looks down from heaven on the children of men,<br>
    to see if there are any who understood,<br>
    who sought after God.<br>
    3 Every one of them has gone back.<br>
    They have become filthy together.<br>
    There is no one who does good, no, not one.<br>
    4 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge,<br>
    who eat up my people as they eat bread,<br>
    and don’t call on God?<br>
    5 There they were in great fear, where no fear was.<br>
    For God has scattered the bones of him who encamps against you.<br>
    You have put them to shame,<br>
    because God has rejected them.<br>
    6 Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion!<br>
    When God brings back the captivity of his people,<br>
    then Jacob shall rejoice,<br>
    and Israel shall be glad.

    3 For strangers have risen up against me.<br>
    Violent men have sought after my soul.<br>
    They haven’t set God before them.<br>
    Selah.<br>
    4 Behold, God is my helper.<br>
    The Lord is the one who sustains my soul.<br>
    5 He will repay the evil to my enemies.<br>
    Destroy them in your truth.<br>
    6 With a free will offering, I will sacrifice to you.<br>
    I will give thanks to your name, Lord, for it is good.<br>
    7 For he has delivered me out of all trouble.<br>
    My eye has seen triumph over my enemies.

  <h4>Proverbs 11:1–15</h4>
  <p>
    1 A false balance is an abomination to the Lord,<br>
    but accurate weights are his delight.<br>
    2 When pride comes, then comes shame,<br>
    but with humility comes wisdom.<br>
    3 The integrity of the upright shall guide them,<br>
    but the perverseness of the treacherous shall destroy them.<br>
    4 Riches don’t profit in the day of wrath,<br>
    but righteousness delivers from death.<br>
    5 The righteousness of the blameless will direct his way,<br>
    but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.<br>
    6 The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them,<br>
    but the unfaithful will be trapped by evil desires.<br>
    7 When a wicked man dies, hope perishes,<br>
    and expectation of power comes to nothing.<br>
    8 A righteous person is delivered out of trouble,<br>
    and the wicked takes his place.<br>
    9 With his mouth, the godless man destroys his neighbor,<br>
    but the righteous will be delivered through knowledge.<br>
    10 When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices.<br>
    When the wicked perish, there is shouting.<br>
    11 By the blessing of the upright, the city is exalted,<br>
    but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.<br>
    12 One who despises his neighbor is void of wisdom,<br>
    but a man of understanding holds his peace.<br>
    13 One who brings gossip betrays a confidence,<br>
    but one who is of a trustworthy spirit is one who keeps a secret.<br>
    14 Where there is no wise guidance, the nation falls,<br>
    but in the multitude of counselors there is victory.<br>
    15 He who is collateral for a stranger will suffer for it,<br>
    but he who refuses pledges of collateral is secure.

  <h4>Sirach 19</h4>
  <p>
    1 A laborer who is a drunkard will not become rich.<br>
    He who despises small things will fall little by little.<br>
    2 Wine and women will make men of understanding fall away.<br>
    He who joins himself to prostitutes is a hero of confusion.<br>
    3 Moths and worms will have him as their heritage.<br>
    A reckless soul will be taken away.<br>
    4 One who trusts quickly has a shallow heart,<br>
    and one who sins does wrong to his own soul.<br>
    5 One who rejoices in wickedness will be condemned,<br>
    but one who hates talking has less wickedness.<br>
    6 Never repeat a discourse, and you won’t lose anything.<br>
    7 Don’t talk about it to friend or foe,<br>
    and unless it is a sin to you, don’t reveal it.<br>
    8 For he has heard you and observed you,<br>
    and when the time comes he will hate you.<br>
    9 Have you heard a word? Let it die with you.<br>
    Be brave! It will not burst you.<br>
    10 A fool will travail in pain with a word,<br>
    as a woman in labor with a child.<br>
    11 As an arrow stuck in a thigh of flesh,<br>
    so is a word in a fool’s belly.<br>
    12 Reprove a friend. It may be he didn’t do it.<br>
    If he did, that he may not do it again.<br>
    13 Reprove your neighbor. It may be he didn’t say it.<br>
    If he has said it, that he may not say it again.<br>
    14 Reprove a friend, for there is often slander,<br>
    and don’t trust every rumor.<br>
    15 There is one who slips, and not from the heart.<br>
    Who has not sinned with his tongue?<br>
    16 Reprove your neighbor before you threaten him,<br>
    and give place to the law of the Most High.<br>
    17 The fear of the Lord is the first step to be accepted;<br>
    wisdom obtains his love.<br>
    18 The knowledge of the commandments of the Lord is life-giving instruction.<br>
    Those who practice the things that please him will receive the fruit of the tree of immortality.<br>
    19 All wisdom is the fear of the Lord.<br>
    In all wisdom is the fulfilling of the law.<br>
    20 The knowledge of wickedness is not wisdom.<br>
    The prudence of sinners is not counsel.<br>
    21 There is a cleverness which is an abomination.<br>
    There is a fool lacking in wisdom.<br>
    22 Better is the one who has small understanding and fears,<br>
    than one who has much prudence and transgresses the law.<br>
    23 There is an exquisite subtlety, and it is unjust.<br>
    There is one who distorts favor to gain judgment.<br>
    24 There is one who does wickedly, bowed down in mourning;<br>
    but inwardly he is full of deceit.<br>
    25 There is one who humbles himself exceedingly with a great lowliness,<br>
    but there is one who hangs down his head and pretends.<br>
    26 By such ways one sits bowed down,<br>
    and the other stares and dissimulates,<br>
    or he will be unknown by reason of his concealment,<br>
    and will be enabled to do harm without being noticed.<br>
    27 If you don’t take heed to yourself in such a person,<br>
    you will be overthrown before you are aware of it.

  <h2>Day 20</h2>
  
  <!-- Psalms 55, 56 -->
  <h3>Psalms</h3>

  <h4>Psalm 55</h4>
  <p>
    1 Listen to my prayer, God.<br>
    Don’t hide yourself from my supplication.<br>
    2 Attend to me, and answer me.<br>
    I am restless in my complaint,<br>
    and moan<br>
    3 because of the voice of the enemy,<br>
    because of the oppression of the wicked.<br>
    For they bring suffering on me.<br>
    In anger they hold a grudge against me.<br>
    4 My heart is severely pained within me.<br>
    The terrors of death have fallen on me.<br>
    5 Fearfulness and trembling have come on me.<br>
    Horror has overwhelmed me.<br>
    6 I said, “Oh that I had wings like a dove!<br>
    Then I would fly away, and be at rest.<br>
    7 Behold, then I would wander far off.<br>
    I would lodge in the wilderness.”<br>
    Selah.<br>
    8 “I would hurry to a shelter from the stormy wind and storm.”<br>
    9 Confuse them, Lord, and confound their language,<br>
    for I have seen violence and strife in the city.<br>
    10 Day and night they prowl around on its walls.<br>
    Malice and abuse are also within her.<br>
    11 Destructive forces are within her.<br>
    Threats and lies don’t depart from her streets.<br>
    12 For it was not an enemy who insulted me,<br>
    then I could have endured it.<br>
    Neither was it he who hated me who raised himself up against me,<br>
    then I would have hidden myself from him.<br>
    13 But it was you, a man like me,<br>
    my companion, and my familiar friend.<br>
    14 We took sweet fellowship together.<br>
    We walked in God’s house with company.<br>
    15 Let death come suddenly on them.<br>
    Let them go down alive into Sheol.<br>
    For wickedness is among them, in their dwelling.<br>
    16 As for me, I will call on God.<br>
    The Lord will save me.<br>
    17 Evening, morning, and at noon, I will cry out in distress.<br>
    He will hear my voice.<br>
    18 He has redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me,<br>
    although there are many who oppose me.<br>
    19 God, who is enthroned forever,<br>
    will hear, and answer them.<br>
    Selah.<br>
    They never change<br>
    and don’t fear God.<br>
    20 He raises his hands against his friends.<br>
    He has violated his covenant.<br>
    21 His mouth was smooth as butter,<br>
    but his heart was war.<br>
    His words were softer than oil,<br>
    yet they were drawn swords.<br>
    22 Cast your burden on the Lord, and he will sustain you.<br>
    He will never allow the righteous to be moved.<br>
    23 But you, God, will bring them down into the pit of destruction.<br>
    Bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days,<br>
    but I will trust in you.
  </p>

  <h4>Psalm 56</h4>
  <p>
    1 Be merciful to me, God, for man wants to swallow me up.<br>
    All day long, he attacks and oppresses me.<br>
    2 My enemies want to swallow me up all day long,<br>
    for they are many who fight proudly against me.<br>
    3 When I am afraid,<br>
    I will put my trust in you.<br>
    4 In God, I praise his word.<br>
    In God, I put my trust.<br>
    I will not be afraid.<br>
    What can flesh do to me?<br>
    5 All day long they twist my words.<br>
    All their thoughts are against me for evil.<br>
    6 They conspire and lurk.<br>
    They watch my steps, they are eager to take my life.<br>
    7 Shall they escape by iniquity?<br>
    In anger cast down the peoples, God.<br>
    8 You count my wanderings.<br>
    You put my tears into your container.<br>
    Aren’t they in your book?<br>
    9 Then my enemies shall turn back in the day that I call.<br>
    I know this: that God is for me.<br>
    10 In God, I will praise his word.<br>
    In the Lord, I will praise his word.<br>
    11 I have put my trust in God.<br>
    I will not be afraid.<br>
    What can man do to me?<br>
    12 Your vows are on me, God.<br>
    I will give thank offerings to you.<br>
    13 For you have delivered my soul from death,<br>
    and prevented my feet from falling,<br>
    that I may walk before God in the light of the living.

  <p>
    16 A gracious woman obtains honor,<br>
    but violent men obtain riches.<br>
    17 The merciful man does good to his own soul,<br>
    but he who is cruel troubles his own flesh.<br>
    18 Wicked people earn deceitful wages,<br>
    but one who sows righteousness reaps a sure reward.<br>
    19 He who is truly righteous gets life.<br>
    He who pursues evil gets death.<br>
    20 Those who are perverse in heart are an abomination to the Lord,<br>
    but those whose ways are blameless are his delight.<br>
    21 Most certainly, the evil man will not be unpunished,<br>
    but the offspring of the righteous will be delivered.<br>
    22 Like a gold ring in a pig’s snout,<br>
    is a beautiful woman who lacks discretion.<br>
    23 The desire of the righteous is only good.<br>
    The expectation of the wicked is wrath.<br>
    24 There is one who scatters, and increases yet more.<br>
    There is one who withholds more than is appropriate, but gains poverty.<br>
    25 The liberal soul shall be made fat.<br>
    He who waters shall be watered also himself.<br>
    26 People curse someone who withholds grain,<br>
    but blessing will be on the head of him who sells it.<br>
    27 He who diligently seeks good seeks favor,<br>
    but he who searches after evil, it shall come to him.<br>
    28 He who trusts in his riches will fall,<br>
    but the righteous shall flourish like the green leaf.<br>
    29 He who troubles his own house shall inherit the wind.<br>
    The foolish shall be servant to the wise of heart.<br>
    30 The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life.<br>
    He who is wise wins souls.<br>
    31 Behold, the righteous shall be repaid in the earth;<br>
    how much more the wicked and the sinner!

  <!-- Sirach 20 -->
  <h3>Sirach</h3>
  <h4>Sirach 20</h4>
  <p>
    1 There is a reproof which is not timely,<br>
    and there is a man who keeps silent and is wise.<br>
    2 How good it is to reprove rather than to stay angry!<br>
    He who confesses will be kept from loss.<br>
    3 Like a eunuch who desires to violate a virgin is he<br>
    who executes judgments by violence.<br>
    4 One man keeps silent, and is found wise;<br>
    another is hated for his much talking.<br>
    5 One man keeps silent, for he has no answer to give;<br>
    and another keeps silent, knowing his time.<br>
    6 A wise man will be silent until the right moment;<br>
    but the braggart and fool goes beyond the right moment.<br>
    7 He who uses many words will be abhorred.<br>
    He who takes authority for himself will be hated.<br>
    8 There is a prosperity in the midst of adversity;<br>
    and there is a gain in the midst of loss.<br>
    9 There is a gift that will not profit you;<br>
    and there is a gift whose repayment is double.<br>
    10 There is an abasement because of glory;<br>
    and there is one who has lifted up his head from a low estate.<br>
    11 There is one who buys much for a small price,<br>
    yet pays for it again seven times over.<br>
    12 A wise man makes himself beloved by his words;<br>
    but the courtesies of fools are wasted.<br>
    13 A fool’s gift will profit you nothing,<br>
    for his eyes are many instead of one.<br>
    14 He will give little, and upbraid much.<br>
    He will open his mouth like a crier.<br>
    Today he will lend,<br>
    and tomorrow he will ask it back.<br>
    Such a one is hateful to the Lord and man.<br>
    15 A fool will say, “I have no friend.<br>
    I have no thanks for all my good deeds.<br>
    Those who eat my bread speak evil of me.”<br>
    16 How often, and how many will he be laughed at!<br>
    For he doesn’t know aright what it is to have.<br>
    17 Even everything is not enough for him.<br>
    He will be filled with his own foolish ways.<br>
    18 A slip on the pavement is better than a slip with the tongue.<br>
    So the downfall of the wicked will come speedily.<br>
    19 An ungracious man is like a foolish story,<br>
    frequently told out of a fool’s mouth.<br>
    20 A parable from the mouth of a fool will be rejected,<br>
    for he doesn’t speak it in its proper time.<br>
    21 There is one who is hindered from sinning through lack,<br>
    and in such a case he will not be troubled.<br>
    22 Another man may destroy his life through shame;<br>
    and he destroys it through lack of foolish boldness.<br>
    23 He who promises to a friend for a favor,<br>
    and gains him as an enemy for nothing,<br>
    is a bad debtor.<br>
    24 A lie is a foul blot in a man.<br>
    It will be continually in the mouth of the ignorant.<br>
    25 A thief is better than a man who is used to lying,<br>
    but they both will inherit destruction.<br>
    26 The ways of those who are godly will not fail,<br>
    but a sinner will stumble in wickedness.<br>
    27 He who talks foolishly is hateful.<br>
    He will be lacking in every way.<br>
    28 A wise man will advance himself by his words,<br>
    and one who is prudent will please great men.<br>
    29 He who tills his land will raise his harvest high.<br>
    He who pleases great men will obtain pardon for iniquity.<br>
    30 Presents and gifts blind the eyes of the wise,<br>
    and like a muzzle on the mouth, they turn away reproofs.<br>
    31 Hidden wisdom and a treasure not seen—<br>
    what profit is in them both?<br>
    32 Better is he who hides his folly<br>
    than he who hides his wisdom.<br>
    33 Cherish a shame that is saving<br>
    rather than a shame which brings sin.<br>
    34 There is one who keeps silent because he has no answer to give;<br>
    and there is one who keeps silent, knowing his time.<br>
    35 A wise man will keep silent until the right moment,<br>
    but a braggart and fool goes beyond the right moment.

    2 I cry out to God Most High,<br>
    to God who accomplishes my requests for me.<br>

    You weigh out the violence of your hands in the earth.<br>
    3 The wicked go astray from the womb.<br>
    They are wayward as soon as they are born, speaking lies.<br>
    4 Their poison is like the poison of a snake;<br>
    like a deaf cobra that stops its ear,<br>
    5 which doesn’t listen to the voice of charmers,<br>
    no matter how skillful the charmer may be.<br>
    6 Break their teeth, God, in their mouth.<br>
    Break out the great teeth of the young lions, Lord.<br>
    7 Let them vanish like water that flows away.<br>
    When they draw the bow, let their arrows be made blunt.<br>
    8 Let them be like a snail which melts and passes away,<br>
    like the stillborn child, who has not seen the sun.<br>
    9 Before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns,<br>
    he will sweep away the green and the burning alike.<br>
    10 The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance.<br>
    He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.<br>
    11 So that men shall say, “Most certainly there is a reward for the righteous.<br>
    Most certainly there is a God who judges the earth.”

    Swords are in their lips, “For,” they say, “who hears us?”<br>
    8 But you, Lord, laugh at them.<br>
    You scoff at all the nations.<br>
    9 Oh, my Strength, I watch for you,<br>
    for God is my high tower.<br>
    10 My God will go before me with his loving kindness.<br>
    God will let me look at my enemies in triumph.<br>
    11 Don’t kill them, or my people may forget.<br>
    Scatter them by your power, and bring them down, Lord our shield.<br>
    12 For the sin of their mouth, and the words of their lips,<br>
    let them be caught in their pride,<br>
    for the curses and lies which they utter.<br>
    13 Consume them in wrath.<br>
    Consume them, and they will be no more.<br>
    Let them know that God rules in Jacob,<br>
    to the ends of the earth.<br>
    Selah.<br>
    14 At evening let them return.<br>
    Let them howl like a dog, and go around the city.<br>
    15 They shall wander up and down for food,<br>
    and wait all night if they aren’t satisfied.<br>
    16 But I will sing of your strength.<br>
    Yes, I will sing aloud of your loving kindness in the morning.<br>
    For you have been my high tower,<br>
    a refuge in the day of my distress.<br>
    17 To you, my strength, I will sing praises.<br>
    For God is my high tower, the God of my mercy.

    So the house of a proud man will be laid waste.<br>
    5 The prayer of a poor man goes from his mouth to the Lord’s ears,<br>
    and his judgment comes speedily.<br>
    6 One who hates reproof is in the path of the sinner,<br>
    but he who fears the Lord will repent in his heart.<br>
    7 He who is mighty in tongue is known from afar.<br>
    A sensible man knows when he slips.<br>
    8 He who builds his house with other men’s money is like one who gathers stones for his own tomb.<br>
    9 The congregation of wicked men is like a heap of tow wrapped together.<br>
    Their end is a flame of fire.<br>
    10 The way of sinners is made smooth with stones,<br>
    but at its end is the pit of Hades.<br>
    11 He who keeps the law becomes master of its intent.<br>
    The fear of the Lord brings wisdom.<br>
    12 He who is not clever will not be taught,<br>
    but there is a cleverness which multiplies bitterness.<br>
    13 The knowledge of a wise man will be made abundant like a flood,<br>
    and his counsel is like a spring of life.<br>
    14 The inner parts of a fool are like a broken vessel.<br>
    He will hold no knowledge.<br>
    15 If an understanding man hears a wise word, he will commend it,<br>
    and add to it.<br>
    The self-indulgent hears it, and it displeases him,<br>
    and he throws it behind his back.<br>
    16 The talking of a fool is like a burden in the way,<br>
    but grace will be found on the lips of the wise.<br>
    17 The mouth of the prudent man will be sought in the congregation.<br>
    They will ponder his words in their heart.<br>
    18 As a house that is destroyed, so is wisdom to a fool.<br>
    The knowledge of the unwise is words without sense.<br>
    19 Instruction is like chains of gold on the feet of an understanding man,<br>
    and like manacles on his right hand.<br>
    20 A fool lifts up his voice with laughter,<br>
    but a clever man smiles quietly.<br>
    21 Instruction is to a prudent man like a golden ornament,<br>
    and like a bracelet on the right arm.<br>
    22 The foot of a fool rushes into a house,<br>
    but a man of experience stands respectfully outside.<br>
    23 A boor peeps through the door into the house,<br>
    but a courteous man stands outside.<br>
    24 It is rude for a man to listen at the door,<br>
    and a man of prudence will be grieved by the disgrace.<br>
    25 The lips of strangers will speak of these things;<br>
    but the words of the prudent will be weighed in the balance.<br>
    26 The heart of fools is in their mouth;<br>
    but the mouth of wise men is their heart.<br>
    27 When the ungodly curses Satan, he curses his own soul.<br>
    28 A whisperer defiles his own soul,<br>
    and will be hated wherever he travels.

  <!-- Psalms 60, 61, 62, 63 -->
  <h3>Psalms</h3>

  <h4>Psalm 60</h4>
  <p>
    1 God, you have rejected us. You have broken us down.<br>
    You have been angry. Restore us, again.<br>
    2 You have made the land tremble. You have torn it.<br>
    Mend its fractures, for it quakes.<br>
    3 You have shown your people hard things.<br>
    You have made us drink the wine that makes us stagger.<br>
    4 You have given a banner to those who fear you,<br>
    that it may be displayed because of the truth.<br>
    Selah.<br>
    5 So that your beloved may be delivered,<br>
    save with your right hand, and answer us.<br>
    6 God has spoken from his sanctuary:<br>
    “I will triumph.<br>
    I will divide Shechem,<br>
    and measure out the valley of Succoth.<br>
    7 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine.<br>
    Ephraim also is the defense of my head.<br>
    Judah is my scepter.<br>
    8 Moab is my wash pot.<br>
    I will toss my sandal on Edom.<br>
    I will shout in triumph over Philistia.”<br>
    9 Who will bring me into the strong city?<br>
    Who has led me to Edom?<br>
    10 Haven’t you, God, rejected us?<br>
    You don’t go out with our armies, God.<br>
    11 Give us help against the adversary,<br>
    for the help of man is vain.<br>
    12 Through God we will do valiantly,<br>
    for it is he who will tread down our adversaries.
  </p>

  <h4>Psalm 61</h4>
  <p>
    1 Hear my cry, God.<br>
    Listen to my prayer.<br>
    2 From the end of the earth, I will call to you when my heart is overwhelmed.<br>
    Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.<br>
    3 For you have been a refuge for me,<br>
    a strong tower from the enemy.<br>
    4 I will dwell in your tent forever.<br>
    I will take refuge in the shelter of your wings.<br>
    Selah.<br>
    5 For you, God, have heard my vows.<br>
    You have given me the heritage of those who fear your name.<br>
    6 You will prolong the king’s life.<br>
    His years will be for generations.<br>
    7 He shall be enthroned in God’s presence forever.<br>
    Appoint your loving kindness and truth, that they may preserve him.<br>
    8 So I will sing praise to your name forever,<br>
    that I may fulfill my vows daily.
  </p>

  <h4>Psalm 62</h4>
  <p>
    1 My soul rests in God alone.<br>
    My salvation is from him.<br>
    2 He alone is my rock and my salvation—my fortress.<br>
    I will never be greatly shaken.<br>
    3 How long will you assault a man?<br>
    Would all of you throw him down,<br>
    like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence?<br>
    4 They fully intend to topple him from his lofty place.<br>
    They delight in lies.<br>
    They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly.<br>
    Selah.<br>
    5 My soul, wait in silence for God alone,<br>
    for my expectation is from him.<br>
    6 He alone is my rock and my salvation—my fortress.<br>
    I will not be shaken.<br>
    7 My salvation and my honor is with God.<br>
    The rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.<br>
    8 Trust in him at all times, you people.<br>
    Pour out your heart before him.<br>
    God is a refuge for us.<br>
    Selah.<br>
    9 Surely men of low degree are just a breath,<br>
    and men of high degree are a lie.<br>
    In the balances they will go up.<br>
    They are together lighter than a breath.<br>
    10 Don’t trust in oppression.<br>
    Don’t become vain in robbery.<br>
    If riches increase,<br>
    don’t set your heart on them.<br>
    11 God has spoken once;<br>
    twice I have heard this,<br>
    that power belongs to God.<br>
    12 Also to you, Lord, belongs loving kindness,<br>
    for you reward every man according to his work.
  </p>

  <h4>Psalm 63</h4>
  <p>
    1 God, you are my God. I will earnestly seek you.<br>
    My soul thirsts for you.<br>
    My flesh longs for you,<br>
    in a dry and weary land, where there is no water.<br>
    2 So I have seen you in the sanctuary,<br>
    watching your power and your glory.<br>
    3 Because your loving kindness is better than life,<br>
    my lips shall praise you.<br>
    4 So I will bless you while I live.<br>
    I will lift up my hands in your name.<br>
    5 My soul shall be satisfied as with the richest food.<br>
    My mouth shall praise you with joyful lips,<br>
    6 when I remember you on my bed,<br>
    and think about you in the night watches.<br>
    7 For you have been my help.<br>
    I will rejoice in the shadow of your wings.<br>
    8 My soul stays close to you.<br>
    Your right hand holds me up.<br>
    9 But those who seek my soul to destroy it<br>
    shall go into the lower parts of the earth.<br>
    10 They shall be given over to the power of the sword.<br>
    They shall be jackal food.<br>
    11 But the king shall rejoice in God.<br>
    Everyone who swears by him will praise him,<br>
    for the mouth of those who speak lies shall be silenced.

  <!-- Proverbs 12:15–28 -->
  <h3>Proverbs</h3>
  <h4>Proverbs 12:15–28</h4>
  <p>
    15 The way of a fool is right in his own eyes,<br>
    but he who is wise listens to counsel.<br>
    16 A fool shows his annoyance the same day,<br>
    but one who overlooks an insult is prudent.<br>
    17 He who is truthful testifies honestly,<br>
    but a false witness lies.<br>
    18 There is one who speaks rashly like the piercing of a sword,<br>
    but the tongue of the wise heals.<br>
    19 Truth’s lips will be established forever,<br>
    but a lying tongue is only momentary.<br>
    20 Deceit is in the heart of those who plot evil,<br>
    but joy comes to the promoters of peace.<br>
    21 No mischief shall happen to the righteous,<br>
    but the wicked shall be filled with evil.<br>
    22 Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord,<br>
    but those who do the truth are his delight.<br>
    23 A prudent man keeps his knowledge,<br>
    but the hearts of fools proclaim foolishness.<br>
    24 The hands of the diligent shall rule,<br>
    but laziness ends in slave labor.<br>
    25 Anxiety in a man’s heart weighs it down,<br>
    but a kind word makes it glad.<br>
    26 A righteous person is cautious in friendship,<br>
    but the way of the wicked leads them astray.<br>
    27 The slothful man doesn’t roast his game,<br>
    but the possessions of diligent men are prized.<br>
    28 In the way of righteousness is life;<br>
    in its path there is no death.

  <!-- Sirach 22 -->
  <h3>Sirach</h3>
  <h4>Sirach 22</h4>
  <p>
    1 A slothful man is compared to a filthy stone,<br>
    and everyone hisses him out to his disgrace.<br>
    2 A slothful man is compared to the filth of a dunghill.<br>
    Every man who picks it up will shake it out of his hand.<br>
    3 An evil-nurtured son is the dishonor of his father,<br>
    and a foolish daughter is born to his loss.<br>
    4 A prudent daughter will inherit a husband of her own;<br>
    but she who brings shame is a grief to the one who bore her.<br>
    5 A shameless woman will be counted as a dog,<br>
    but she who is shamefaced will fear the Lord.<br>
    6 A woman who honors her husband will appear wise to all,<br>
    but one who dishonors her husband in her pride will be known to all.<br>
    All men shall condemn her.<br>
    7 Indolence leads to decay, and slackness to lowering of the roof.<br>
    8 The gathering of stories is like a burden upon the foolish man’s back.<br>
    9 An instructor of fools is like one who glues broken pottery together,<br>
    or like one who wakes someone out of a deep sleep.<br>
    10 He who tells a story to a fool tells it to a drowsy man.<br>
    In the end, he will say, “What is it?”<br>
    11 Weep for the dead, for light has failed him;<br>
    and weep for a fool, for understanding has failed him.<br>
    Weep more sweetly for the dead, because he has found rest;<br>
    but the life of the fool is worse than death.<br>
    12 Mourning for the dead lasts seven days;<br>
    but for a fool or an ungodly man, all the days of his life.<br>
    13 Don’t talk much with a foolish man,<br>
    and don’t go to one who has no understanding.<br>
    Beware of him, lest you have trouble<br>
    and be defiled when he shakes himself.<br>
    Stay away from him, and you will find rest,<br>
    and won’t be wearied by his madness.<br>
    14 What would be heavier than lead?<br>
    And what is its name but “fool”?<br>
    15 Sand, salt, and a mass of iron are easier to bear<br>
    than a man without understanding.<br>
    16 A wooden beam bound together in a building will not be dissolved by an earthquake;<br>
    so a heart established in trained thought will not be afraid in a crisis.<br>
    17 A heart settled on intelligent thought is as a stucco decoration on a polished wall.<br>
    18 Piles of gravel placed on a high place will not endure against the wind;<br>
    so a fearful heart in the imagination of a fool will not stand against any fear.<br>
    19 He who pricks the eye will make tears fall;<br>
    and he who pricks the heart makes it show feeling.<br>
    20 Whoever throws a stone at birds scares them away;<br>
    and he who upbraids a friend will dissolve friendship.<br>
    21 If you have drawn a sword against your friend, don’t despair;<br>
    for there may be a way back.<br>
    22 If you have opened your mouth against your friend, don’t be afraid;<br>
    for there may be reconciliation—unless it be for insulting or arrogance or disclosing a secret or a treacherous blow.<br>
    In these cases, any friend will flee.<br>
    23 Gain trust with your neighbor in his poverty,<br>
    that in his prosperity you may be full of his good things.<br>
    Stand by him in the time of his affliction,<br>
    that you may be an heir with him in his inheritance.<br>
    24 The vapor and smoke of the furnace precede the fire;<br>
    so insults precede bloodshed.<br>
    25 I will not be ashamed to shelter a friend;<br>
    I won’t hide myself from his face.<br>
    26 If any evil happens to me because of him,<br>
    everyone who hears it will beware of him.<br>
    27 Who will set a guard over my mouth<br>
    and put a seal of shrewdness on my lips,<br>
    that I don’t fall from it,<br>
    and that my tongue doesn’t destroy me?

  <h4>Psalm 64</h4>
  <p>
    1 Hear my voice, God, in my complaint.<br>
    Preserve my life from fear of the enemy.<br>
    2 Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked,<br>
    from the noisy crowd of the ones doing evil;<br>
    3 who sharpen their tongue like a sword,<br>
    and aim their arrows, deadly words,<br>
    4 to shoot innocent men from ambushes.<br>
    They shoot at him suddenly and fearlessly.<br>
    5 They encourage themselves in evil plans.<br>
    They talk about laying snares secretly.<br>
    They say, “Who will see them?”<br>
    6 They plot injustice, saying, “We have made a perfect plan!”<br>
    Surely man’s mind and heart are cunning.<br>
    7 But God will shoot at them.<br>
    They will be suddenly struck down with an arrow.<br>
    8 Their own tongues shall ruin them.<br>
    All who see them will shake their heads.<br>
    9 All mankind shall be afraid.<br>
    They shall declare the work of God,<br>
    and shall wisely ponder what he has done.<br>
    10 The righteous shall be glad in the Lord,<br>
    and shall take refuge in him.<br>
    All the upright in heart shall praise him!

  <h4>Psalm 65</h4>
  <p>
    1 Praise waits for you, God, in Zion.<br>
    Vows shall be performed to you.<br>
    2 You who hear prayer,<br>
    all men will come to you.<br>
    3 Sins overwhelmed me,<br>
    but you atoned for our transgressions.<br>
    4 Blessed is the one whom you choose and cause to come near,<br>
    that he may live in your courts.<br>
    We will be filled with the goodness of your house,<br>
    your holy temple.<br>
    5 By awesome deeds of righteousness, you answer us,<br>
    God of our salvation.<br>
    You who are the hope of all the ends of the earth,<br>
    of those who are far away on the sea.<br>
    6 By your power, you form the mountains,<br>
    having armed yourself with strength.<br>
    7 You still the roaring of the seas,<br>
    the roaring of their waves,<br>
    and the turmoil of the nations.<br>
    8 They also who dwell in far-away places are afraid at your wonders.<br>
    You call the morning’s dawn and the evening with songs of joy.<br>
    9 You visit the earth and water it.<br>
    You greatly enrich it.<br>
    The river of God is full of water.<br>
    You provide them grain, for so you have ordained it.<br>
    10 You drench its furrows.<br>
    You level its ridges.<br>
    You soften it with showers.<br>
    You bless it with a crop.<br>
    11 You crown the year with your bounty.<br>
    Your carts overflow with abundance.<br>
    12 The wilderness grasslands overflow.<br>
    The hills are clothed with gladness.<br>
    13 The pastures are covered with flocks.<br>
    The valleys also are clothed with grain.<br>
    They shout for joy!<br>
    They also sing.

  <h4>Psalm 66</h4>
  <p>
    1 Make a joyful shout to God, all the earth!<br>
    2 Sing to the glory of his name!<br>
    Offer glory and praise!<br>
    3 Tell God, “How awesome are your deeds!<br>
    Through the greatness of your power, your enemies submit themselves to you.<br>
    4 All the earth will worship you,<br>
    and will sing to you;<br>
    they will sing to your name.”<br>
    Selah.<br>
    5 Come, and see God’s deeds—<br>
    awesome work on behalf of the children of men.<br>
    6 He turned the sea into dry land.<br>
    They went through the river on foot.<br>
    There, we rejoiced in him.<br>
    7 He rules by his might forever.<br>
    His eyes watch the nations.<br>
    Don’t let the rebellious rise up against him.<br>
    Selah.<br>
    8 Oh bless our God, you peoples!<br>
    Make the sound of his praise heard,<br>
    9 who preserves our life among the living,<br>
    and doesn’t allow our feet to be moved.<br>
    10 For you, God, have tested us.<br>
    You have refined us, as silver is refined.<br>
    11 You brought us into prison.<br>
    You laid a burden on our backs.<br>
    12 You allowed men to ride over our heads.<br>
    We went through fire and through water,<br>
    but you brought us to the place of abundance.<br>
    13 I will come into your temple with burnt offerings.<br>
    I will pay my vows to you,<br>
    14 which my lips promised,<br>
    and my mouth spoke, when I was in distress.<br>
    15 I will offer to you burnt offerings of fat animals,<br>
    with the offering of rams.<br>
    I will offer bulls with goats.<br>
    Selah.<br>
    16 Come and hear, all you who fear God.<br>
    I will declare what he has done for my soul.<br>
    17 I cried to him with my mouth.<br>
    He was extolled with my tongue.<br>
    18 If I cherished sin in my heart,<br>
    the Lord wouldn’t have listened.<br>
    19 But most certainly, God has listened.<br>
    He has heard the voice of my prayer.<br>
    20 Blessed be God, who has not turned away my prayer,<br>
    nor his loving kindness from me.

  <h4>Proverbs 13:1–13</h4>
  <p>
    1 A wise son listens to his father’s instruction,<br>
    but a scoffer doesn’t listen to rebuke.<br>
    2 By the fruit of his lips, a man enjoys good things,<br>
    but the unfaithful crave violence.<br>
    3 He who guards his mouth guards his soul.<br>
    One who opens wide his lips comes to ruin.<br>
    4 The soul of the sluggard desires, and has nothing,<br>
    but the desire of the diligent shall be fully satisfied.<br>
    5 A righteous man hates lies,<br>
    but a wicked man is loathsome, and comes to shame.<br>
    6 Righteousness guards the way of integrity,<br>
    but wickedness overthrows the sinner.<br>
    7 There are some who pretend to be rich, yet have nothing.<br>
    There are some who pretend to be poor, yet have great wealth.<br>
    8 The ransom of a man’s life is his riches,<br>
    but the poor hear no threats.<br>
    9 The light of the righteous shines brightly,<br>
    but the lamp of the wicked is snuffed out.<br>
    10 Pride only breeds quarrels,<br>

    11 Wealth gained dishonestly dwindles away,<br>
    but he who gathers by hand makes it grow.<br>
    12 Hope deferred makes the heart sick,<br>

  <p>
    1 O Lord, Father and Master of my life,<br>
    don’t give me a proud look,<br>
    but turn away impure thoughts from me.<br>
    2 Let neither lust nor desires take hold of me;<br>
    and don’t give over me to a shameless soul.<br>
    3 O Lord, Father, and God of my life,<br>
    don’t give me a proud look.<br>
    4 Turn away from me vain hopes and lustful desires.<br>
    Hold me back from gluttony,<br>
    5 and don’t let me fall by it.<br>
    6 Listen, my children, to the discipline of my mouth.<br>
    He who keeps it will not be taken.<br>
    7 The sinner will be overtaken through his lips,<br>
    and the insulter and the proud man will fall by them.<br>
    8 Don’t let your mouth get used to making oaths,<br>
    and don’t habitually mention the holy name.<br>
    9 For as a servant who is often scourged can’t lack a bruise,<br>
    so he also who swears and utters the Name continually will not be blameless.<br>
    10 A man of many oaths will be filled with lawlessness,<br>
    and the scourge will not depart from his house.<br>
    If he offends, his sin will be on him.<br>
    If he disregards it, he has sinned doubly.<br>
    If he has sworn in vain, he will not be justified,<br>
    for his house will be filled with calamities.<br>
    11 There is a way of speaking comparable to death.<br>
    Let it not be found in the heritage of Jacob,<br>
    for all these things will be far from the godly,<br>
    and they will not wallow in sins.<br>
    12 Don’t accustom your mouth to lewd expressions;<br>
    for in it, there is the sin of a word.<br>
    13 Remember your father and mother<br>
    when you sit among great men.<br>
    Don’t forget yourself before them,<br>
    and become a fool by habit.<br>
    Then you wish that you had not been born,<br>
    and curse the day of your nativity.<br>
    14 A man who is accustomed to words of reproach<br>
    will never be corrected all the days of his life.<br>
    15 Two sorts of men multiply sins,<br>
    and a third will bring wrath:<br>
    a hot mind like a burning fire will not be quenched until it is consumed;<br>
    a fornicator in the body of his flesh will never cease until he has burned out the fire.<br>
    16 All bread is sweet to a fornicator.<br>
    He will not cease until he dies.<br>
    17 A man who goes astray from his bed says in his heart,<br>
    “Who sees me?<br>
    Darkness is around me, and the walls hide me.<br>
    No one sees me. Of whom am I afraid?<br>
    The Most High will not remember my sins.”<br>
    18 The eyes of men are his fear.<br>
    He doesn’t know that the eyes of the Lord are ten thousand times brighter than the sun,<br>
    seeing all the ways of men,<br>
    and looking into hidden places.<br>
    19 All things were known to him before they were created.<br>
    So they were also after they were perfected.<br>
    20 This man will be punished in the streets of the city.<br>
    He will be seized where he didn’t think of.<br>
    21 So it is with a wife who leaves her husband,<br>
    and brings in an heir by a stranger.<br>
    22 For first, she was disobedient to the law of the Most High.<br>
    Secondly, she trespassed against her own husband.<br>
    Thirdly, she played the adulteress in whoredom,<br>
    and brought children by another man.<br>
    23 She will be brought out into the assembly,<br>
    and punishment will fall on her children.<br>
    24 Her children will not take root.<br>
    Her branches will not bear fruit.<br>
    25 She will leave her memory for a curse.<br>
    Her reproach will not be blotted out.<br>
    26 Those who are left will know that there is nothing better than the fear of the Lord,<br>
    and nothing sweeter than to take heed to the commandments of the Lord.<br>
    27 It is great glory to follow the Lord.<br>
    Length of days will be received from him.

  <h4>Psalm 68</h4>
  <p>
    1 Let God arise! Let his enemies be scattered!<br>
    Let them who hate him also flee before him.<br>
    2 As smoke is driven away, so drive them away.<br>
    As wax melts before the fire,<br>
    so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.<br>
    3 But let the righteous be glad.<br>
    Let them rejoice before God.<br>
    Yes, let them rejoice with gladness.<br>
    4 Sing to God! Sing praises to his name!<br>
    Extol him who rides on the clouds—his name is the Lord!<br>
    Rejoice before him.<br>
    5 A father of the fatherless, and a defender of widows,<br>
    is God in his holy habitation.<br>
    6 God sets the lonely in families.<br>
    He brings out the prisoners with singing,<br>
    but the rebellious dwell in a sun-scorched land.<br>
    7 God, when you went out before your people,<br>
    when you marched through the wilderness...<br>
    Selah.<br>
    8 The earth trembled.<br>
    The sky also poured down rain at the presence of the God of Sinai—<br>
    at the presence of God, the God of Israel.<br>
    9 You, God, sent a plentiful rain.<br>
    You confirmed your inheritance when it was weary.<br>
    10 Your congregation lived therein.<br>
    You, God, prepared your goodness for the poor.<br>
    11 The Lord announced the word.<br>
    The ones who proclaim it are a great company.<br>
    12 “Kings of armies flee! They flee!”<br>
    She who waits at home divides the plunder,<br>
    13 while you sleep among the camp fires,<br>
    the wings of a dove sheathed with silver,<br>
    her feathers with shining gold.<br>
    14 When the Almighty scattered kings in her,<br>
    it snowed on Zalmon.<br>
    15 The mountains of Bashan are majestic mountains.<br>
    The mountains of Bashan are rugged.<br>
    16 Why do you look in envy, you rugged mountains,<br>
    at the mountain where God chooses to reign?<br>
    Yes, the Lord will dwell there forever.<br>
    17 The chariots of God are tens of thousands and thousands of thousands.<br>
    The Lord is among them, from Sinai, into the sanctuary.<br>
    18 You have ascended on high.<br>
    You have led away captives.<br>
    You have received gifts among men,<br>
    yes, among the rebellious also, that the Lord God might dwell there.<br>
    19 Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears our burdens,<br>
    the God of our salvation.<br>
    Selah.<br>
    20 God is to us a God of deliverance.<br>
    To the Lord, the Lord, belongs escape from death.<br>
    21 But God will strike through the head of his enemies,<br>
    the hairy scalp of such a one as still continues in his guiltiness.<br>
    22 The Lord said, “I will bring you again from Bashan.<br>
    I will bring you again from the depths of the sea,<br>
    23 that you may crush them, dipping your foot in blood,<br>
    that the tongues of your dogs may have their portion from your enemies.”<br>
    24 They have seen your processions, God,<br>
    even the processions of my God, my King, into the sanctuary.<br>
    25 The singers went before, the minstrels followed after,<br>
    among the ladies playing with tambourines.<br>
    26 “Bless God in the congregations,<br>
    even the Lord in the assembly of Israel!”<br>
    27 There is little Benjamin, their ruler,<br>
    the princes of Judah, their council,<br>
    the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali.<br>
    28 Your God has commanded your strength.<br>
    Strengthen, God, that which you have done for us.<br>
    29 Because of your temple at Jerusalem,<br>
    kings shall bring presents to you.<br>
    30 Rebuke the wild animal of the reeds,<br>
    the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the peoples.<br>
    Trample under foot the bars of silver.<br>
    He has scattered the nations that delight in war.<br>
    31 Princes shall come out of Egypt.<br>
    Ethiopia shall hurry to stretch out her hands to God.<br>
    32 Sing to God, you kingdoms of the earth!<br>
    Sing praises to the Lord!<br>
    Selah.<br>
    33 To him who rides on the heaven of heavens, which are of old;<br>
    behold, he utters his voice, a mighty voice.<br>
    34 Ascribe strength to God!<br>
    His excellency is over Israel,<br>
    his strength is in the skies.<br>
    35 You are awesome, God, in your sanctuaries.<br>
    The God of Israel gives strength and power to his people.<br>
    Praise be to God!

  <h4>Proverbs 13:14–25</h4>
  <p>
    14 The teaching of the wise is a spring of life,<br>
    to turn from the snares of death.<br>
    15 Good understanding wins favor,<br>
    but the way of the unfaithful is hard.<br>
    16 Every prudent man acts from knowledge,<br>
    but a fool exposes folly.<br>
    17 A wicked messenger falls into trouble,<br>
    but a trustworthy envoy gains healing.<br>
    18 Poverty and shame come to him who refuses discipline,<br>
    but he who heeds correction shall be honored.<br>
    19 Longing fulfilled is sweet to the soul,<br>
    but fools detest turning from evil.<br>
    20 One who walks with wise men grows wise,<br>
    but a companion of fools suffers harm.<br>
    21 Misfortune pursues sinners,<br>
    but prosperity rewards the righteous.<br>
    22 A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s children,<br>
    but the wealth of the sinner is stored for the righteous.<br>
    23 An abundance of food is in poor people’s fields,<br>
    but injustice sweeps it away.<br>
    24 One who spares the rod hates his son,<br>
    but one who loves him is careful to discipline him.<br>
    25 The righteous one eats to the satisfying of his soul,<br>
    but the belly of the wicked goes hungry.

  <p>
    1 Wisdom will praise herself,<br>
    and will glory in the midst of her people.<br>
    2 In the assembly of the Most High, she will open her mouth,<br>
    and glorify herself in the presence of his power:<br>
    3 “I came out of the mouth of the Most High,<br>
    and covered the earth like a mist.<br>
    4 I lived in high places,<br>
    and my throne is in a pillar of cloud.<br>
    5 Alone I have made the circuit of the sky,<br>
    and walked in the depth of the abyss.<br>
    6 In the waves of the sea, in all the earth,<br>
    and in every people and nation, I have gotten a possession.<br>
    7 With all these, I sought rest.<br>
    In whose inheritance shall I lodge?<br>
    8 Then the Creator of all things gave me a command.<br>
    He who created me made my tent to rest,<br>
    and said, ‘Let your dwelling be in Jacob,<br>
    and your inheritance in Israel.’<br>
    9 He created me from the beginning before the world,<br>
    and I will never cease.<br>
    10 In the holy tabernacle, I served before him.<br>
    So I was established in Zion.<br>
    11 In the beloved city, he gave me rest.<br>
    In Jerusalem was my authority.<br>
    12 I took root in a glorified people,<br>
    in the portion of the Lord who is their inheritance.<br>
    13 I was exalted like a cedar in Lebanon,<br>
    and like a cypress on the mountains of Hermon.<br>
    14 I was exalted like a palm tree on the sea shore,<br>
    and as rose plants in Jericho,<br>
    and as a fair olive tree in the plain.<br>
    I was exalted as a plane tree.<br>
    15 I gave a pleasant fragrance like cinnamon and aspalathus.<br>
    I yielded a scent like the best myrrh,<br>
    like galbanum, onyx, and sweet storax,<br>
    and as the smoke of frankincense in the tent.<br>
    16 I spread out my branches like a terebinth.<br>
    My branches are glorious and graceful.<br>
    17 I am like a vine bud, and my blossoms are the fruit of honor and riches.

  <h4>Psalm 69</h4>
  <p>
    1 Save me, God,<br>
    for the waters have come up to my neck!<br>
    2 I sink in deep mire, where there is no foothold.<br>
    I have come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.<br>
    3 I am weary with my crying. My throat is dry.<br>
    My eyes fail looking for my God.<br>
    4 Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head.<br>
    Those who want to cut me off, being my enemies wrongfully, are mighty.<br>
    I have to restore what I didn’t take away.<br>
    5 God, you know my foolishness.<br>
    My sins aren’t hidden from you.<br>
    6 Don’t let those who wait for you be shamed through me, Lord God of Armies.<br>
    Don’t let those who seek you be brought to dishonor through me, God of Israel.<br>
    7 Because for your sake, I have borne reproach.<br>
    Shame has covered my face.<br>
    8 I have become a stranger to my brothers,<br>
    an alien to my mother’s children.<br>
    9 For the zeal of your house consumes me.<br>
    The reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen on me.<br>
    10 When I wept and I fasted,<br>
    that was to my reproach.<br>
    11 When I made sackcloth my clothing,<br>
    I became a byword to them.<br>
    12 Those who sit in the gate talk about me.<br>
    I am the song of the drunkards.<br>
    13 But as for me, my prayer is to you, Lord, in an acceptable time.<br>
    God, in the abundance of your loving kindness, answer me in the truth of your salvation.<br>
    14 Deliver me out of the mire, and don’t let me sink.<br>
    Let me be delivered from those who hate me, and out of the deep waters.<br>
    15 Don’t let the flood waters overwhelm me,<br>
    neither let the deep swallow me up.<br>
    Don’t let the pit shut its mouth on me.<br>
    16 Answer me, Lord, for your loving kindness is good.<br>
    According to the multitude of your tender mercies, turn to me.<br>
    17 Don’t hide your face from your servant,<br>
    for I am in distress. Answer me speedily!<br>
    18 Draw near to my soul, and redeem it.<br>
    Ransom me because of my enemies.<br>
    19 You know my reproach, my shame, and my dishonor.<br>
    My adversaries are all before you.<br>
    20 Reproach has broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness.<br>
    I looked for some to take pity, but there was none;<br>
    for comforters, but I found none.<br>
    21 They also gave me poison for my food.<br>
    In my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink.<br>
    22 Let their table before them become a snare.<br>
    May it become a retribution and a trap.<br>
    23 Let their eyes be darkened, so that they can’t see.<br>
    Let their backs be continually bent.<br>
    24 Pour out your indignation on them.<br>
    Let the fierceness of your anger overtake them.<br>
    25 Let their habitation be desolate.<br>
    Let no one dwell in their tents.<br>
    26 For they persecute him whom you have wounded.<br>
    They tell of the sorrow of those whom you have hurt.<br>
    27 Charge them with crime upon crime.<br>
    Don’t let them come into your righteousness.<br>
    28 Let them be blotted out of the book of life,<br>
    and not be written with the righteous.<br>
    29 But I am in pain and distress.<br>
    Let your salvation, God, protect me.<br>
    30 I will praise the name of God with a song,<br>
    and will magnify him with thanksgiving.<br>
    31 It will please the Lord better than an ox,<br>
    or a bull that has horns and hoofs.<br>
    32 The humble have seen it, and are glad.<br>
    You who seek after God, let your heart live.<br>
    33 For the Lord hears the needy,<br>
    and doesn’t despise his captive people.<br>
    34 Let heaven and earth praise him;<br>
    the seas, and everything that moves in them!<br>
    35 For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah.<br>
    They shall settle there, and own it.<br>
    36 The children also of his servants shall inherit it.<br>
    Those who love his name shall dwell in it.

    but he who is perverse in his ways despises him.<br>
    3 The fool’s talk brings a rod to his back,<br>

    7 Stay away from a foolish man,<br>
    for you won’t find knowledge on his lips.<br>
    8 The wisdom of the prudent is to think about his way,<br>

    9 Fools mock at making atonement for sins,<br>
    but amongst the upright there is good will.<br>
    10 The heart knows its own bitterness and joy;<br>

    15 A simple man believes everything,<br>
    but the prudent man carefully considers his ways.<br>
    16 A wise man fears and shuns evil,<br>

    33 Wisdom rests in the heart of one who has understanding,<br>
    and is even made known in the inward part of fools.<br>
    34 Righteousness exalts a nation,<br>
    but sin is a disgrace to any people.<br>
    35 The king’s favor is toward a servant who deals wisely,<br>
    but his wrath is towards one who causes shame.

  <h3>Sirach</h3>
  <h4>Sirach 25</h4>
  <p>
    1 Three things I was beautified with, and stood up beautiful before the Lord and men:<br>
    The unity of brethren, the friendship of neighbors, and a woman and her husband walking together in agreement.<br>
    2 But three sorts of men my soul hates,<br>
    and I am greatly offended at their life:<br>
    a poor man that is arrogant, a rich man who is a liar,<br>
    and an old man who is an adulterer lacking understanding.<br>
    3 In your youth you haven’t gathered,<br>
    how then will you find anything in your old age?<br>
    4 How beautiful a thing is judgment for gray hairs,<br>
    and for elders to know counsel!<br>
    5 How beautiful is the wisdom of old men,<br>
    and thought and counsel to those who are honorable!<br>
    6 Much experience is the crown of old men,<br>
    and the fear of God is their glory.<br>
    7 There are nine things that I have thought of,<br>
    and my heart has magnified them:<br>
    a man that delights in his children,<br>
    a man who lives to see the fall of his enemies.<br>
    8 Blessed is he who dwells with a wife of understanding;<br>
    he who has not slipped with his tongue,<br>
    and he who has not served a man who is unworthy of him.<br>
    9 Blessed is he who has found prudence.<br>
    Even one who speaks in the ears of those who listen.<br>
    10 How great is he who has found wisdom!<br>
    Yet there is none above him who fears the Lord.<br>
    11 The fear of the Lord passes all things.<br>
    He who holds it, to whom shall he be likened?<br>
    12 Any wound, but not a wound of the heart.<br>
    Any wickedness, but not the wickedness of a wife.<br>
    13 Any attack, but not an attack from enemies.<br>
    Any vengeance, but not the vengeance of enemies.<br>
    14 There is no head worse than the head of a serpent.<br>
    There is no anger above the anger of an enemy.<br>
    He who has indulged a wife in mischief<br>
    will flee from her wrath.<br>
    15 The wickedness of a woman changes her appearance,<br>
    and darkens her countenance like a bear.<br>
    16 Her husband will sit among his neighbors,<br>
    and when he hears it, he sighs bitterly.<br>
    17 All malice is small compared to a woman’s malice.<br>
    Let a sinner fall upon her!<br>
    18 As going up a sandy way for the feet of the aged,<br>
    so is a wife full of words to a quiet man.<br>
    19 Don’t be ensnared by a woman’s beauty,<br>
    and don’t desire a woman for her possessions.<br>
    20 There is anger, and impudence, and great reproach,<br>
    if a woman supports her husband.<br>
    21 A headstrong wife is a moth in her husband’s house,<br>
    and she eats up his fortune piece by piece.<br>
    22 A wicked woman abates the courage,<br>
    makes a heavy countenance and a wounded heart.<br>
    A woman that doesn’t make her husband happy<br>
    weakens hands and slackens knees.<br>
    23 From a woman came the beginning of sin,<br>
    and because of her, we all die.<br>
    24 Don’t give a woman power over you<br>
    to trample upon your strength.<br>
    25 Don’t go to meet a woman who plays the prostitute,<br>
    lest perhaps you fall into her snares.<br>
    26 Don’t be with a singer, lest you be caught by her attempts.<br>
    27 Don’t gaze at a maid, lest you fall by those things<br>
    that are precious in her.<br>
    28 Don’t give your soul to prostitutes,<br>
    that you not lose your inheritance.<br>
    29 Don’t look around in the streets of the city,<br>
    neither wander in its deserted places.<br>
    30 Turn your eye away from a beautiful woman,<br>
    and don’t gaze at another’s beauty.<br>
    Many have been led astray by the beauty of a woman;<br>
    by it, passion is kindled like a fire.<br>
    31 Don’t sit at all with another man’s wife,<br>
    or share the wine with her in revelry,<br>
    lest your heart turn away from her,<br>
    and you go down in blood to the pit.

  <h4>Psalm 72</h4>
  <p>
    1 God, give the king your justice;<br>
    your righteousness to the royal son.<br>
    2 He will judge your people with righteousness,<br>
    and your poor with justice.<br>
    3 The mountains shall bring prosperity to the people.<br>
    The hills bring the fruit of righteousness.<br>
    4 He will judge the poor of the people.<br>
    He will save the children of the needy,<br>
    and will break the oppressor in pieces.<br>
    5 They shall fear you while the sun endures;<br>
    and as long as the moon, throughout all generations.<br>
    6 He will come down like rain on the mown grass,<br>
    as showers that water the earth.<br>
    7 In his days, the righteous shall flourish,<br>
    and abundance of peace, until the moon is no more.<br>
    8 He shall have dominion also from sea to sea,<br>
    from the River to the ends of the earth.<br>
    9 Those who dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him.<br>
    His enemies shall lick the dust.<br>
    10 The kings of Tarshish and of the islands will bring tribute.<br>
    The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.<br>
    11 Yes, all kings shall fall down before him.<br>
    All nations shall serve him.<br>
    12 For he will deliver the needy when he cries;<br>
    the poor, who has no helper.<br>
    13 He will have pity on the poor and needy.<br>
    He will save the souls of the needy.<br>
    14 He will redeem their soul from oppression and violence.<br>
    Their blood will be precious in his sight.<br>
    15 They shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba.<br>
    Men shall pray for him continually.<br>
    They shall bless him all day long.<br>
    16 Abundance of grain shall be throughout the land.<br>
    Its fruit sways like Lebanon.<br>
    Let it flourish like the grass of the field.<br>
    17 His name endures forever.<br>
    His name continues as long as the sun.<br>
    Men shall be blessed by him.<br>
    All nations will call him blessed.<br>
    18 Praise be to the Lord God, the God of Israel,<br>
    who alone does marvelous deeds.<br>
    19 Blessed be his glorious name forever!<br>
    Let the whole earth be filled with his glory!<br>
    Amen and amen.<br>
    20 This ends the prayers by David, the son of Jesse.

  <h4>Psalm 73</h4>
  <p>
    1 Surely God is good to Israel,<br>
    to those who are pure in heart.<br>
    2 But as for me, my feet were almost gone.<br>
    My steps had nearly slipped.<br>
    3 For I was envious of the arrogant,<br>
    when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.<br>
    4 For there are no struggles in their death,<br>
    but their strength is firm.<br>
    5 They are free from burdens of men,<br>
    neither are they plagued like other men.<br>
    6 Therefore pride is like a chain around their neck.<br>
    Violence covers them like a garment.<br>
    7 Their eyes bulge with fat.<br>
    Their minds pass the limits of conceit.<br>
    8 They scoff and speak with malice.<br>
    In arrogance, they threaten oppression.<br>
    9 They have set their mouth in the heavens.<br>
    Their tongue walks through the earth.<br>
    10 Therefore their people return to them,<br>
    and they drink up waters of abundance.<br>
    11 They say, “How does God know?<br>
    Is there knowledge in the Most High?”<br>
    12 Behold, these are the wicked.<br>
    Being always at ease, they increase in riches.<br>
    13 Surely I have cleansed my heart in vain,<br>
    and washed my hands in innocence,<br>
    14 For all day long I have been plagued,<br>
    and punished every morning.<br>
    15 If I had said, “I will speak thus,”<br>
    behold, I would have betrayed the generation of your children.<br>
    16 When I tried to understand this,<br>
    it was too painful for me—<br>
    17 until I entered God’s sanctuary,<br>
    and considered their latter end.<br>
    18 Surely you set them in slippery places.<br>
    You throw them down to destruction.<br>
    19 How they are suddenly destroyed!<br>
    They are completely swept away by terrors.<br>
    20 As a dream when one wakes up,<br>
    so, Lord, when you awake, you will despise their fantasies.<br>
    21 For my soul was grieved.<br>
    I was embittered in my heart.<br>
    22 I was so senseless and ignorant.<br>
    I was a brute beast before you.<br>
    23 Nevertheless, I am continually with you.<br>
    You have held my right hand.<br>
    24 You will guide me with your counsel,<br>
    and afterward receive me to glory.<br>
    25 Whom do I have in heaven? There is no one on earth whom I desire besides you.<br>
    26 My flesh and my heart fails,<br>
    but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.<br>
    27 For, behold, those who are far from you shall perish.<br>
    You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you.<br>
    28 But it is good for me to come close to God.<br>
    I have made the Lord God my refuge,<br>
    that I may tell of all your works.

  <h4>Proverbs 15:1–15</h4>
  <p>
    1 A gentle answer turns away wrath,<br>
    but a harsh word stirs up anger.<br>
    2 The tongue of the wise commends knowledge,<br>
    but the mouth of fools gush out folly.<br>
    3 The Lord’s eyes are everywhere,<br>
    keeping watch on the evil and the good.<br>
    4 A gentle tongue is a tree of life,<br>
    but deceit in it crushes the spirit.<br>
    5 A fool despises his father’s correction,<br>
    but he who heeds reproof shows prudence.<br>
    6 In the house of the righteous is much treasure,<br>
    but the income of the wicked brings trouble.<br>
    7 The lips of the wise spread knowledge;<br>
    not so with the heart of fools.<br>
    8 The sacrifice made by the wicked is an abomination to the Lord,<br>
    but the prayer of the upright is his delight.<br>
    9 The way of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord,<br>
    but he loves him who follows after righteousness.<br>
    10 There is stern discipline for one who forsakes the way.<br>
    Whoever hates reproof shall die.<br>
    11 Sheol and Abaddon are before the Lord—<br>
    how much more then the hearts of the children of men!<br>
    12 A scoffer doesn’t love to be reproved.<br>
    He will not go to the wise.<br>
    13 A glad heart makes a cheerful countenance,<br>
    but an aching heart breaks the spirit.<br>
    14 The heart of one who has understanding seeks knowledge,<br>
    but the mouths of fools feed on folly.<br>
    15 All the days of the afflicted are wretched,<br>
    but one who has a cheerful heart enjoys a continual feast.

  <h4>Sirach 26</h4>
  <p>
    1 Blessed is the man who has a virtuous wife,<br>
    for the number of his days will be doubled.<br>
    2 A noble wife rejoices her husband,<br>
    and he will fulfill his years in peace.<br>
    3 A good wife is a good portion;<br>
    she will be given in the portion of those who fear the Lord.<br>
    4 Whether a man is rich or poor,<br>
    he has a good heart toward the Lord;<br>
    he will at all times cheerfully look on his face.<br>
    5 There are three things which my heart fears,<br>
    and concerning the fourth I am greatly afraid:<br>
    the slander of a city,<br>
    the gathering together of a mob,<br>
    and a false accusation.<br>
    All these are worse than death.<br>
    6 A grief of heart and sorrow is a woman who is jealous over another woman.<br>
    Scourging of the tongue which communicates to all.<br>
    7 A wicked wife is as a yoke of oxen shaken to and fro.<br>
    He who takes hold of her is as one who grasps a scorpion.<br>
    8 A drunken woman causes great wrath.<br>
    She won’t cover her own shame.<br>
    9 The whoredom of a woman is in the lifting up of her eyes;<br>
    and it will be known by her eyelids.<br>
    10 Keep strict watch over a headstrong daughter,<br>
    lest she find liberty for herself, and use it.<br>
    11 Watch over an impudent eye,<br>
    and don’t be surprised if it trespasses against you.<br>
    12 She will open her mouth, as a thirsty traveler does,<br>
    and drink of every water that is near.<br>
    She will sit down at every post,<br>
    and open her quiver against every arrow.<br>
    13 The grace of a wife will delight her husband.<br>
    Her knowledge will fatten his bones.<br>
    14 A silent wife is a gift from the Lord,<br>
    and there is nothing worth so much as a well-instructed soul.<br>
    15 A modest wife is a blessing upon blessing.<br>
    There is no scale adequate to weigh a self-controlled soul.<br>
    16 As the sun when it arises in the Lord’s high heavens,<br>
    so is the beauty of a good wife in her well-ordered house.<br>
    17 As the lamp shining upon the holy candlestick,<br>
    so is the beauty of the face in ripe age.<br>
    18 As golden pillars upon a silver base,<br>
    so are beautiful feet with the breasts of one who is steadfast.<br>
    19 My son, keep the flower of your age sound;<br>
    and don’t give your strength to strangers.<br>
    20 When you have gotten a fruitful possession in every field,<br>
    sow it with your own seed, trusting in your noble descent.<br>
    21 So your race which you leave will be magnified,<br>
    having the confidence of their good descent.<br>
    22 A harlot will be considered as spittle;<br>
    but a married woman is a tower of death to those who use her.<br>
    23 A wicked woman is given as a portion to a wicked man;<br>
    but a godly woman is given to him who fears the Lord.<br>
    24 A shameless woman deals shamefully with her father and husband;<br>
    but a modest woman will fear the Lord.<br>
    25 A woman that honors her husband will be judged wise by everyone;<br>
    but she who dishonors him in her pride will be known to everyone as ungodly.<br>
    Blessed is the wife of a good husband,<br>
    for the number of her years will be doubled.<br>
    26 A loud-voiced and garrulous woman is like a trumpet sounding the battle alarm,<br>
    which signals the attack of an enemy.<br>
    27 A wife who is envious of another woman’s virtue is a scourge to the heart.<br>
    28 There are two things that grieve my heart,<br>
    and the third arouses me to anger:<br>
    a man of war who suffers poverty,<br>
    men of understanding who are treated with contempt,<br>
    and one who turns from righteousness to sin—<br>
    the Lord prepares such a one for the sword.<br>
    29 A merchant can hardly keep himself from wrongdoing,<br>
    and a shopkeeper will not be acquitted of sin.

  <p>
    1 God, why have you rejected us forever?<br>
    Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture?<br>
    2 Remember your congregation, which you purchased of old,<br>
    which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your inheritance:<br>
    Mount Zion, in which you have lived.<br>
    3 Lift up your feet to the perpetual ruins,<br>
    all the evil that the enemy has done in the sanctuary.<br>
    4 Your adversaries have roared in the middle of your assembly.<br>
    They have set up their standards as signs.<br>
    5 They behaved like men wielding axes,<br>
    cutting through a thicket of trees.<br>
    6 Now they break all its carved work down with hatchet and hammers.<br>
    7 They have burned your sanctuary to the ground.<br>
    They have profaned the dwelling place of your Name.<br>
    8 They said in their heart, “We will crush them completely.”<br>
    They have burned up all the places in the land where God was worshiped.<br>
    9 We see no miraculous signs.<br>
    There is no longer any prophet,<br>
    neither is there among us anyone who knows how long.<br>
    10 How long, God, shall the adversary reproach?<br>
    Shall the enemy blaspheme your name forever?<br>
    11 Why do you draw back your hand, even your right hand?<br>
    Take it from your chest and consume them!<br>
    12 Yet God is my King of old,<br>
    working salvation throughout the earth.<br>
    13 You divided the sea by your strength.<br>
    You broke the heads of the sea monsters in the waters.<br>
    14 You broke the heads of Leviathan in pieces.<br>
    You gave him as food to people and desert creatures.<br>
    15 You opened up spring and stream.<br>
    You dried up mighty rivers.<br>
    16 The day is yours, the night is also yours.<br>
    You have prepared the light and the sun.<br>
    17 You have set all the boundaries of the earth.<br>
    You have made summer and winter.<br>
    18 Remember this, that the enemy has mocked you, Lord.<br>
    Foolish people have blasphemed your name.<br>
    19 Don’t deliver the soul of your dove to wild beasts.<br>
    Don’t forget the life of your poor forever.<br>
    20 Honor your covenant,<br>
    for haunts of violence fill the dark places of the earth.<br>
    21 Don’t let the oppressed return ashamed.<br>
    Let the poor and needy praise your name.<br>
    22 Arise, God! Plead your own cause.<br>
    Remember how the foolish man mocks you all day.<br>
    23 Don’t forget the voice of your adversaries.<br>
    The tumult of those who rise up against you ascends continually.

    I will judge blamelessly.<br>
    3 The earth and all its inhabitants quake.<br>
    I firmly hold its pillars.<br>

    4 I said to the arrogant, “Don’t boast!”<br>
    I said to the wicked, “Don’t lift up the horn.<br>
    5 Don’t lift up your horn on high.<br>
    Don’t speak with a stiff neck.”<br>
    6 For neither from the east, nor from the west,<br>
    nor yet from the south, comes exaltation.<br>
    7 But God is the judge.<br>
    He puts down one, and lifts up another.<br>
    8 For in the Lord’s hand there is a cup,<br>
    full of foaming wine mixed with spices.<br>
    He pours it out.<br>
    Indeed the wicked of the earth drink and drain it to its dregs.<br>
    9 But I will declare this forever:<br>
    I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.<br>
    10 I will cut off all the horns of the wicked,<br>
    but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.

    20 A wise son makes a father glad,<br>

    23 Joy comes to a man with the reply of his mouth.<br>
    How good is a word at the right time!<br>
    24 The path of life leads upward for the wise,<br>

    26 The Lord detests the thoughts of the wicked,<br>
    but the thoughts of the pure are pleasing.<br>
    27 He who is greedy for gain troubles his own house,<br>
    but he who hates bribes will live.<br>
    28 The heart of the righteous weighs answers,<br>
    but the mouth of the wicked gushes out evil.<br>
    29 The Lord is far from the wicked,<br>
    but he hears the prayer of the righteous.<br>
    30 The light of the eyes rejoices the heart.<br>
    Good news puts fat on the bones.<br>
    31 The ear that listens to reproof lives,<br>
    and will remain among the wise.<br>
    32 He who refuses correction despises his own soul,<br>
    but he who listens to reproof gets understanding.<br>
    33 The fear of the Lord teaches wisdom.<br>
    Before honor is humility.

    1 Many have sinned for a small matter;<br>
    he who seeks for abundance will turn his eyes away.<br>
    2 As a stake is driven firmly into a fissure between stones,<br>
    so sin thrusts in between buying and selling.<br>
    3 Unless a man holds diligently to the fear of the Lord,<br>
    his house will soon be overthrown.<br>
    4 In the shaking of a sieve, the refuse remains,<br>
    so the filth of man in his reasoning.<br>
    5 The furnace tests the potter’s vessel;<br>
    so the test of man is in his reasoning.<br>
    6 The fruit of a tree discloses the cultivation of it.<br>
    So the declaration of a man’s reasoning is the test of him.<br>
    7 Praise no man before you hear his reasoning;<br>
    for this is the test of men.<br>
    8 If you follow righteousness, you will obtain her,<br>
    and put her on as a splendid robe.<br>
    9 Birds will resort to their like;<br>
    and truth will return to those who practice her.<br>
    10 The lion lies in wait for prey;<br>
    so does sin for those who work iniquity.<br>
    11 The discourse of a godly man is always wisdom,<br>
    but the foolish man changes like the moon.<br>
    12 Among stupid people, watch for a chance to depart;<br>
    but among thoughtful people, linger on.<br>
    13 The discourse of fools is offensive,<br>
    and their laughter is in the wantonness of sin.<br>
    14 The talk of men given to swearing makes one’s hair stand upright,<br>
    and their quarrels make people stop their ears.<br>
    15 The strife of the proud ends in bloodshed,<br>
    and their insults are grievous to hear.<br>
    16 He who reveals secrets destroys credit,<br>
    and will not find a close friend.<br>
    17 Love your friend, and be faithful to him;<br>
    but if you reveal his secrets, don’t follow him any more.<br>
    18 For as a man has destroyed his enemy,<br>
    so have you destroyed the friendship of your neighbor.<br>
    19 As you have let a bird out of your hand,<br>
    so have you let your neighbor go, and will not catch him again.<br>
    20 Don’t go after him, for he is gone far away,<br>
    and has escaped like a gazelle out of the snare.<br>
    21 For a wound may be bound up,<br>
    and an insult is forgiven;<br>
    but he who betrays secrets is without hope.<br>
    22 One who winks with the eye contrives evil;<br>
    and no one will remove him from it.<br>
    23 When you are present, he speaks sweetly,<br>
    and will admire your words;<br>
    but afterward he will twist his speech,<br>
    and set a trap in your words.<br>
    24 I have hated many things, but I have not done as he did,<br>
    neither will I do it, at any price.<br>
    25 One throws a stone on high; it will fall on his own head;<br>
    and a deceitful stroke will open wounds.<br>
    26 He who digs a pit will fall into it;<br>
    he who sets a snare will be caught in it.<br>
    27 If a man does evil, it will roll back upon him,<br>
    and he won’t know where it came from.<br>
    28 Mockery and reproach are from the proud;<br>
    and vengeance, as a lion, will lie in wait for him.<br>
    29 Those who rejoice at the fall of the godly will be taken in a snare,<br>
    and anguish will consume them before they die.<br>
    30 Wrath and anger, these also are abominations;<br>
    and a sinful man will possess them.

  <h2>Day 29</h2>

  <!-- Psalms 76, 77 -->
  <h3>Psalms</h3>

  <h4>Psalm 76</h4>
  <p>
    1 In Judah, God is known.<br>
    His name is great in Israel.<br>
    2 His tabernacle is also in Salem.<br>
    His dwelling place in Zion.<br>
    3 There he broke the flaming arrows of the bow,<br>
    the shield, and the sword, and the weapons of war.<br>
    Selah.<br>
    4 Glorious are you, and excellent,<br>
    more than mountains of game.<br>
    5 Valiant men lie plundered.<br>
    They have slept their last sleep.<br>
    None of the men of war can lift their hands.<br>
    6 At your rebuke, God of Jacob,<br>
    both chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.<br>
    7 You, even you, are to be feared.<br>
    Who can stand in your sight when you are angry?<br>
    8 You pronounced judgment from heaven.<br>
    The earth feared, and was silent,<br>
    9 when God arose to judgment,<br>
    to save all the afflicted ones of the earth.<br>
    Selah.<br>
    10 Surely the wrath of man praises you.<br>
    The survivors of your wrath are restrained.<br>
    11 Make vows to the Lord your God, and fulfill them!<br>
    Let all of his neighbors bring presents to him who is to be feared.<br>
    12 He will cut off the spirit of princes.<br>
    He is feared by the kings of the earth.
  </p>

  <h4>Psalm 77</h4>
  <p>
    1 My cry goes to God! Indeed, I cry to God for help,<br>
    and for him to listen to me.<br>
    2 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord.<br>
    My hand was stretched out in the night, and didn’t get tired.<br>
    My soul refused to be comforted.<br>
    3 I remember God, and I groan.<br>
    I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed.<br>
    Selah.<br>
    4 You hold my eyelids open.<br>
    I am so troubled that I can’t speak.<br>
    5 I have considered the days of old,<br>
    the years of ancient times.<br>
    6 I remember my song in the night.<br>
    I consider in my own heart.<br>
    My spirit diligently inquires:<br>
    7 “Will the Lord reject us forever?<br>
    Will he be favorable no more?<br>
    8 Has his loving kindness vanished forever?<br>
    Does his promise fail for generations?<br>
    9 Has God forgotten to be gracious?<br>
    Has he, in anger, withheld his compassion?”<br>
    Selah.<br>
    10 Then I thought, “I will appeal to this:<br>
    the years of the right hand of the Most High.”<br>
    11 I will remember the Lord’s deeds;<br>
    for I will remember your wonders of old.<br>
    12 I will also meditate on all your work,<br>
    and consider your doings.<br>
    13 Your way, God, is in the sanctuary.<br>
    What god is great like God?<br>
    14 You are the God who does wonders.<br>
    You have made your strength known among the peoples.<br>
    15 You have redeemed your people with your arm,<br>
    the sons of Jacob and Joseph.<br>
    Selah.<br>
    16 The waters saw you, God.<br>
    The waters saw you, and they writhed.<br>
    The depths also convulsed.<br>
    17 The clouds poured out water.<br>
    The skies resounded with thunder.<br>
    Your arrows also flashed around.<br>
    18 The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind.<br>
    The lightnings lit up the world.<br>
    The earth trembled and shook.<br>
    19 Your way was through the sea,<br>
    your paths through the great waters.<br>
    Your footsteps were not known.<br>
    20 You led your people like a flock,<br>
    by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
  </p>

  <!-- Proverbs 16:1–17 -->
  <h3>Proverbs</h3>
  <h4>Proverbs 16:1–17</h4>
  <p>
    1 The plans of the heart belong to man,<br>
    but the answer of the tongue is from the Lord.<br>
    2 All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes;<br>
    but the Lord weighs the motives.<br>
    3 Commit your deeds to the Lord,<br>
    and your plans shall succeed.<br>
    4 The Lord has made everything for its own end—<br>
    yes, even the wicked for the day of evil.<br>
    5 Everyone who is proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord;<br>
    they shall certainly not be unpunished.<br>
    6 By mercy and truth iniquity is atoned for.<br>
    By the fear of the Lord men depart from evil.<br>
    7 When a man’s ways please the Lord,<br>
    he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.<br>
    8 Better is a little with righteousness,<br>
    than great revenues with injustice.<br>
    9 A man’s heart plans his course,<br>
    but the Lord directs his steps.<br>
    10 Inspired judgments are on the lips of the king.<br>
    He shall not betray his mouth.<br>
    11 Honest balances and scales are the Lord’s.<br>
    All the weights in the bag are his work.<br>
    12 It is an abomination for kings to do wrong,<br>
    for the throne is established by righteousness.<br>
    13 Righteous lips are the delight of kings.<br>
    They value one who speaks the truth.<br>
    14 The king’s wrath is a messenger of death,<br>
    but a wise man will pacify it.<br>
    15 In the light of the king’s face is life.<br>
    His favor is like a cloud of the spring rain.<br>
    16 How much better it is to get wisdom than gold!<br>
    Yes, to get understanding is to be chosen rather than silver.<br>
    17 The highway of the upright is to depart from evil.<br>
    He who keeps his way preserves his soul.

  <!-- Sirach 28 -->
  <h3>Sirach</h3>
  <h4>Sirach 28</h4>
  <p>
    1 He who takes vengeance will find vengeance from the Lord,<br>
    and he will surely keep his sins in remembrance.<br>
    2 Forgive your neighbor the wrong he has done,<br>
    and then your sins will be pardoned when you pray.<br>
    3 Does one man harbor anger against another,<br>
    and yet seek healing from the Lord?<br>
    4 Does he have no mercy on a man like himself,<br>
    and yet pray for his own sins?<br>
    5 If he who is flesh nourishes wrath,<br>
    who will make atonement for his sins?<br>
    6 Remember your end, and let enmity cease.<br>
    Remember corruption and death,<br>
    and be true to the commandments.<br>
    7 Remember the commandments,<br>
    and don’t be angry with your neighbor.<br>
    Remember the covenant of the Highest,<br>
    and overlook ignorance.<br>
    8 Abstain from strife, and you will diminish your sins;<br>
    for a furious man kindles strife.<br>
    9 A sinful man disquiets friends,<br>
    and sows discord among those who are at peace.<br>
    10 As the matter of the fire is, so it burns;<br>
    and as a man’s strength is, so does his anger be;<br>
    and as his wealth is, so he exalts his wrath.<br>
    11 A hasty contention kindles a fire;<br>
    and a hasty fighting sheds blood.<br>
    12 If you blow on a spark, it will burn.<br>
    If you spit on it, it will be put out;<br>
    yet both come out of your mouth.<br>
    13 Curse the whisperer and the double-tongued,<br>
    for he has destroyed many who were at peace.<br>
    14 Slander has shaken mighty cities<br>
    and overthrown the houses of great men.<br>
    15 Slander has driven away brave women<br>
    and deprived them of their labors.<br>
    16 Whoever listens to it will not find rest;<br>
    nor will he dwell in quietness.<br>
    17 The stroke of a whip makes marks in the flesh,<br>
    but the stroke of the tongue breaks bones.<br>
    18 Many have fallen by the edge of the sword,<br>
    yet not as many as those who have perished by their own tongue.<br>
    19 Happy is he who is sheltered from it,<br>
    who has not passed through the anger of its tongue,<br>
    who has not drawn its yoke,<br>
    and has not been bound by its bands.<br>
    20 For its yoke is a yoke of iron;<br>
    and its bands are bands of brass.<br>
    21 The death it inflicts is an evil death.<br>
    The grave is better than it.<br>
    22 It will not have rule over godly men;<br>
    and they will not be burned in its flame.<br>
    23 Those who forsake the Lord will fall into it.<br>
    It will burn among them and not be put out.<br>
    It will be sent out against them like a lion,<br>
    and as a leopard, it will destroy them.<br>
    24 Look that you hedge your possession about with thorns.<br>
    Bind up your silver and gold.<br>
    25 Make balances and scales for your words,<br>
    and make a door and a bar for your mouth.<br>
    26 Beware that you don’t err with your tongue,<br>
    and fall victim in front of those who lie in wait for you.

  <!-- Psalms 78 -->
  <h3>Psalms</h3>

  <h4>Psalm 78</h4>
  <p>
    1 Hear my teaching, my people.<br>
    Turn your ears to the words of my mouth.<br>
    2 I will open my mouth in a parable.<br>
    I will utter dark sayings of old,<br>
    3 which we have heard and known,<br>
    and our fathers have told us.<br>
    4 We will not hide them from their children,<br>
    telling to the generation to come the praises of the Lord,<br>
    his strength, and his wondrous deeds that he has done.<br>
    5 For he established a covenant in Jacob,<br>
    and appointed a law in Israel,<br>
    which he commanded our fathers,<br>
    that they should make them known to their children,<br>
    6 that the generation to come might know—the children who would be born,<br>
    who should arise and tell their children,<br>
    7 that they might set their hope in God,<br>
    and not forget God’s deeds,<br>
    but keep his commandments,<br>
    8 and might not be as their fathers—a stubborn and rebellious generation,<br>
    a generation that didn’t make their hearts loyal,<br>
    whose spirit was not steadfast with God.<br>
    9 The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows,<br>
    turned back in the day of battle.<br>
    10 They didn’t keep God’s covenant,<br>
    and refused to walk in his law.<br>
    11 They forgot his doings,<br>
    his wondrous deeds that he had shown them.<br>
    12 He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers,<br>
    in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.<br>
    13 He split the sea, and caused them to pass through.<br>
    He made the waters stand as a heap.<br>
    14 In the daytime he also led them with a cloud,<br>
    and all night with a light of fire.<br>
    15 He split rocks in the wilderness,<br>
    and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.<br>
    16 He brought streams also out of the rock,<br>
    and caused waters to run down like rivers.<br>
    17 Yet they still went on to sin against him,<br>
    to rebel against the Most High in the desert.<br>
    18 They tempted God in their heart<br>
    by asking food according to their desire.<br>
    19 Yes, they spoke against God.<br>
    They said, “Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?<br>
    20 Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out,<br>
    and streams overflowed.<br>
    Can he give bread also?<br>
    Will he provide meat for his people?”<br>
    21 Therefore the Lord heard, and was angry.<br>
    A fire was kindled against Jacob,<br>
    anger also went up against Israel,<br>
    22 because they didn’t believe in God,<br>
    and didn’t trust in his salvation.<br>
    23 Yet he commanded the skies above,<br>
    and opened the doors of heaven.<br>
    24 He rained down manna on them to eat,<br>
    and gave them food from the sky.<br>
    25 Man ate the bread of angels.<br>
    He sent them food to the full.<br>
    26 He caused the east wind to blow in the sky.<br>
    By his power he guided the south wind.<br>
    27 He also rained meat on them as the dust,<br>
    winged birds as the sand of the seas.<br>
    28 He let them fall in the middle of their camp,<br>
    around their habitations.<br>
    29 So they ate, and were filled.<br>
    He gave them their own desire.<br>
    30 They didn’t turn from their cravings.<br>
    Their food was yet in their mouths,<br>
    31 when the anger of God went up against them,<br>
    killed some of their strongest,<br>
    and struck down the young men of Israel.<br>
    32 For all this they still sinned,<br>
    and didn’t believe in his wondrous works.<br>
    33 Therefore he consumed their days in vanity,<br>
    and their years in terror.<br>
    34 When he killed them, then they inquired after him.<br>
    They returned and sought God earnestly.<br>
    35 They remembered that God was their rock,<br>
    the Most High God, their redeemer.<br>
    36 But they flattered him with their mouth,<br>
    and lied to him with their tongue.<br>
    37 For their heart was not right with him,<br>
    neither were they faithful in his covenant.<br>
    38 But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity,<br>
    and didn’t destroy them.<br>
    Yes, many times he turned his anger away,<br>
    and didn’t stir up all his wrath.<br>
    39 He remembered that they were but flesh,<br>
    a wind that passes away, and doesn’t come again.<br>
    40 How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness,<br>
    and grieved him in the desert!<br>
    41 They turned again and tempted God,<br>
    and provoked the Holy One of Israel.<br>
    42 They didn’t remember his hand,<br>
    nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;<br>
    43 how he set his signs in Egypt,<br>
    his wonders in the field of Zoan,<br>
    44 turned their rivers into blood,<br>
    and their streams, so that they could not drink.<br>
    45 He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them;<br>
    and frogs, which destroyed them.<br>
    46 He also gave their increase to the caterpillar,<br>
    and their labor to the locust.<br>
    47 He destroyed their vines with hail,<br>
    their sycamore fig trees with frost.<br>
    48 He also gave over their livestock to the hail,<br>
    and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.<br>
    49 He threw on them the fierceness of his anger,<br>
    wrath, indignation, and trouble,<br>
    and a band of angels of evil.<br>
    50 He made a path for his anger.<br>
    He didn’t spare their soul from death,<br>
    but gave their life over to the pestilence,<br>
    51 and struck all the firstborn in Egypt,<br>
    the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.<br>
    52 But he led out his own people like sheep,<br>
    and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.<br>
    53 He led them safely, so that they weren’t afraid,<br>
    but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.<br>
    54 He brought them to the border of his sanctuary,<br>
    to this mountain, which his right hand had taken.<br>
    55 He also drove out the nations before them,<br>
    allotted them for an inheritance by line,<br>
    and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.<br>
    56 Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God,<br>
    and didn’t keep his testimonies,<br>
    57 but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers.<br>
    They were twisted like a deceitful bow.<br>
    58 For they provoked him to anger with their high places,<br>
    and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.<br>
    59 When God heard this, he was angry,<br>
    and greatly abhorred Israel;<br>
    60 so that he forsook the tent of Shiloh,<br>
    the tent which he placed among men,<br>
    61 and delivered his strength into captivity,<br>
    his glory into the adversary’s hand.<br>
    62 He also gave his people over to the sword,<br>
    and was angry with his inheritance.<br>
    63 Fire devoured their young men.<br>
    Their virgins had no wedding song.<br>
    64 Their priests fell by the sword,<br>
    and their widows couldn’t weep.<br>
    65 Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep,<br>
    like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.<br>
    66 He struck his adversaries backward.<br>
    He put them to a perpetual reproach.<br>
    67 Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph,<br>
    and didn’t choose the tribe of Ephraim,<br>
    68 but chose the tribe of Judah,<br>
    Mount Zion which he loved.<br>
    69 He built his sanctuary like the heights,<br>
    like the earth which he has established forever.<br>
    70 He also chose David his servant,<br>
    and took him from the sheepfolds;<br>
    71 from following the ewes that have their young,<br>
    he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people,<br>
    and Israel, his inheritance.<br>
    72 So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart,<br>
    and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.

  <h3>Proverbs</h3>
  <h4>Proverbs 16:18–33</h4>
  <p>
    18 Pride goes before destruction,<br>
    and a haughty spirit before a fall.<br>
    19 It is better to be of a lowly spirit with the poor,<br>
    than to divide the plunder with the proud.<br>
    20 He who heeds the Word finds prosperity.<br>
    Whoever trusts in the Lord is blessed.<br>
    21 The wise in heart shall be called prudent.<br>
    Pleasantness of the lips promotes instruction.<br>
    22 Understanding is a fountain of life to one who has it,<br>
    but the punishment of fools is their folly.<br>
    23 The heart of the wise instructs his mouth,<br>
    and adds learning to his lips.<br>
    24 Pleasant words are a honeycomb,<br>
    sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.<br>
    25 There is a way which seems right to a man,<br>
    but in the end it leads to death.<br>
    26 The appetite of the laboring man labors for him;<br>
    for his mouth urges him on.<br>
    27 A worthless man devises mischief.<br>
    His speech is like a scorching fire.<br>
    28 A perverse man stirs up strife.<br>
    A whisperer separates close friends.<br>
    29 A man of violence entices his neighbor,<br>
    and leads him in a way that is not good.<br>
    30 One who winks his eyes to plot perversities,<br>
    one who compresses his lips, is bent on evil.<br>
    31 Gray hair is a crown of glory.<br>
    It is attained by a life of righteousness.<br>
    32 One who is slow to anger is better than the mighty;<br>
    one who rules his spirit, than he who takes a city.<br>
    33 The lot is cast into the lap,<br>
    but its every decision is from the Lord.

  <h3>Psalms</h3>

  <h4>Psalm 79</h4>
  <p>
    1 God, the nations have come into your inheritance.<br>
    They have defiled your holy temple.<br>
    They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.<br>
    2 They have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food for the birds of the sky,<br>
    the flesh of your saints to the animals of the earth.<br>
    3 They have shed their blood like water around Jerusalem.<br>
    There was no one to bury them.<br>
    4 We have become a reproach to our neighbors,<br>
    a scoffing and derision to those who are around us.<br>
    5 How long, Lord? Will you be angry forever?<br>
    Will your jealousy burn like fire?<br>
    6 Pour out your wrath on the nations that don’t know you,<br>
    on the kingdoms that don’t call on your name,<br>
    7 for they have devoured Jacob,<br>
    and destroyed his homeland.<br>
    8 Don’t hold the iniquities of our forefathers against us.<br>
    Let your tender mercies speedily meet us,<br>
    for we are in desperate need.<br>
    9 Help us, God of our salvation, for the glory of your name.<br>
    Deliver us, and forgive our sins, for your name’s sake.<br>
    10 Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?”<br>
    Let it be known among the nations, before our eyes,<br>
    that vengeance for your servants’ blood is being poured out.<br>
    11 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before you.<br>
    According to the greatness of your power, preserve those who are sentenced to death.<br>
    12 Pay back to our neighbors seven times into their bosom their reproach with which they have reproached you, Lord.<br>
    13 So we, your people and sheep of your pasture,<br>
    will give you thanks forever.<br>
    We will praise you forever, to all generations.

  <h4>Psalm 80</h4>
  <p>
    1 Hear us, Shepherd of Israel,<br>
    you who lead Joseph like a flock,<br>
    you who sit above the cherubim, shine out.<br>
    2 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up your might.<br>
    Come to save us!<br>
    3 Turn us again, God.<br>
    Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.<br>
    4 Lord God of Armies,<br>
    how long will you be angry against the prayer of your people?<br>
    5 You have fed them with the bread of tears,<br>
    and given them tears to drink in large measure.<br>
    6 You make us a source of contention to our neighbors.<br>
    Our enemies laugh among themselves.<br>
    7 Turn us again, God of Armies.<br>
    Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.<br>
    8 You brought a vine out of Egypt.<br>
    You drove out the nations, and planted it.<br>
    9 You cleared the ground for it.<br>
    It took deep root, and filled the land.<br>
    10 The mountains were covered with its shadow.<br>
    Its boughs were like God’s cedars.<br>
    11 It sent out its branches to the sea,<br>
    its shoots to the River.<br>
    12 Why have you broken down its walls,<br>
    so that all those who pass by the way pluck it?<br>
    13 The boar out of the wood ravages it.<br>
    The wild animals of the field feed on it.<br>
    14 Turn again, we beg you, God of Armies.<br>
    Look down from heaven, and see, and visit this vine,<br>
    15 the stock which your right hand planted,<br>
    the branch that you made strong for yourself.<br>
    16 It’s burned with fire.<br>
    It’s cut down.<br>
    They perish at your rebuke.<br>
    17 Let your hand be on the man of your right hand,<br>
    on the son of man whom you made strong for yourself.<br>
    18 So we will not turn away from you.<br>
    Revive us, and we will call on your name.<br>
    19 Turn us again, Lord God of Armies.<br>
    Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.

  <h4>Proverbs 17:1–14</h4>
  <p>
    1 Better is a dry morsel with quietness,<br>
    than a house full of feasting with strife.<br>
    2 A servant who deals wisely will rule over a son who causes shame,<br>
    and shall have a part in the inheritance among the brothers.<br>
    3 The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold,<br>
    but the Lord tests the hearts.<br>
    4 An evildoer heeds wicked lips.<br>
    A liar gives ear to a mischievous tongue.<br>
    5 Whoever mocks the poor reproaches his Maker.<br>
    He who is glad at calamity shall not be unpunished.<br>
    6 Children’s children are the crown of old men;<br>
    the glory of children are their parents.<br>
    7 Arrogant speech isn’t fitting for a fool,<br>
    much less do lying lips fit a prince.<br>
    8 A bribe is a precious stone in the eyes of him who gives it;<br>
    wherever he turns, he prospers.<br>
    9 He who covers an offense promotes love;<br>
    but he who repeats a matter separates best friends.<br>
    10 A rebuke enters deeper into one who has understanding<br>
    than a hundred lashes into a fool.<br>
    11 An evil man seeks only rebellion;<br>
    therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.<br>
    12 Let a bear robbed of her cubs meet a man,<br>
    rather than a fool in his folly.<br>
    13 Whoever rewards evil for good,<br>
    evil shall not depart from his house.<br>
    14 The beginning of strife is like breaching a dam,<br>
    therefore stop contention before quarreling breaks out.

  <h4>Sirach 29</h4>
  <p>
    1 He who shows mercy will lend to his neighbor.<br>
    He who strengthens him with his hand keeps the commandments.<br>
    2 Lend to your neighbor in time of his need.<br>
    Pay your neighbor again in due season.<br>
    3 Confirm your word, and keep faith with him;<br>
    and at all seasons, you will find what you need.<br>
    4 Many have considered a loan as a windfall,<br>
    and have caused trouble to those who helped them.<br>
    5 When he has gotten possession, he will kiss your hands,<br>
    and when he is due to repay, he will delay the time,<br>
    return words of heaviness, and complain of the time.<br>
    6 If he prevails, he will barely get half,<br>
    and he will consider that as if he had found it.<br>
    If not, he has deprived him of his money,<br>
    and he has gotten him for an enemy without cause.<br>
    He will pay him with curses and insults,<br>
    and instead of honor, he will pay him disgrace.<br>
    7 Many have refused to lend for fear of being defrauded,<br>
    yet they have been defrauded anyway by bold persons.<br>
    8 Nevertheless, be patient with a man in poor circumstances;<br>
    don’t keep him waiting for your alms.<br>
    9 Help a poor man for the commandment’s sake.<br>
    According to his need, don’t send him away empty.<br>
    10 Lose your money for a brother or a friend.<br>
    Don’t let it rust under a stone and be lost.<br>
    11 Lay up your treasure according to the commandments of the Most High,<br>
    and it will profit you more than gold.<br>
    12 Store up alms in your storehouses;<br>
    it will deliver you from all affliction.<br>
    13 It will fight for you against your enemy<br>
    better than a mighty shield and a strong spear.<br>
    14 A good man will be surety for his neighbor;<br>
    but one who has lost his shame will fail him.<br>
    15 Don’t forget the good offices of your surety,<br>
    for he has given his life for you.<br>
    16 A sinner wastes the good offices of his surety.<br>
    17 The unthankful man forgets him who delivered him.<br>
    18 Suretyship has undone many who were doing well,<br>
    and shaken them as a wave of the sea.<br>
    Mighty men it has driven from their homes;<br>
    they wandered among foreign nations.<br>
    19 A sinner who falls into suretyship,<br>
    and undertakes contracts for work, will fall into lawsuits.<br>
    20 Help your neighbor according to your power,<br>
    and take heed to yourself that you don’t fall into the same.<br>
    21 The essentials of life are water, bread, and a garment,<br>
    and a house to cover nakedness.<br>
    22 Better is the life of a poor man under a shelter of logs<br>
    than sumptuous fare in another man’s house.<br>
    23 Be content with little or much.<br>
    It is a miserable life to go from house to house.<br>
    24 Where you are a guest, you dare not open your mouth.<br>
    You will entertain and give to drink, and have no thanks;<br>
    besides this, you will hear bitter words:<br>
    25 “Come here, stranger, set the table.<br>
    Feed me the things that you have ready.<br>
    26 Go away, stranger, give place to someone of honor.<br>
    My brother has come to be my guest. I need my house.”<br>
    27 These things are grievous to a man of understanding:<br>
    upbraiding about lodging and the reproach of the creditor.

  <h4>Psalm 81</h4>
  <p>
    1 Sing aloud to God, our strength!<br>
    Make a joyful shout to the God of Jacob!<br>
    2 Raise a song, and bring here the tambourine,<br>
    the pleasant lyre with the harp.<br>
    3 Blow the trumpet at the New Moon,<br>
    at the full moon, on our feast day.<br>
    4 For it is a statute for Israel,<br>
    an ordinance of the God of Jacob.<br>
    5 He appointed it in Joseph as a testimony,<br>
    when he went out over the land of Egypt.<br>
    I heard a language that I didn’t know.<br>
    6 “I removed his shoulder from the burden.<br>
    His hands were freed from the basket.<br>
    7 You called in trouble, and I delivered you.<br>
    I answered you in the secret place of thunder.<br>
    I tested you at the waters of Meribah.”<br>
    Selah.<br>
    8 “Hear, my people, and I will testify to you,<br>
    Israel, if you would listen to me!<br>
    9 There shall be no strange god in you,<br>
    neither shall you worship any foreign god.<br>
    10 I am the Lord, your God,<br>
    who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.<br>
    Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.<br>
    11 But my people didn’t listen to my voice.<br>
    Israel desired none of me.<br>
    12 So I let them go after the stubbornness of their hearts,<br>
    that they might walk in their own counsels.<br>
    13 Oh that my people would listen to me,<br>
    that Israel would walk in my ways!<br>
    14 I would soon subdue their enemies,<br>
    and turn my hand against their adversaries.<br>
    15 The haters of the Lord would cringe before him,<br>
    and their punishment would last forever.<br>
    16 But he would have also fed them with the finest of the wheat.<br>
    I will satisfy you with honey out of the rock.”

  <h4>Psalm 82</h4>
  <p>
    1 God presides in the great assembly.<br>
    He judges among the gods.<br>
    2 “How long will you judge unjustly,<br>
    and show partiality to the wicked?”<br>
    Selah.<br>
    3 “Defend the weak, the poor, and the fatherless.<br>
    Maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed.<br>
    4 Rescue the weak and needy.<br>
    Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked.”<br>
    5 They don’t know, neither do they understand.<br>
    They walk back and forth in darkness.<br>
    All the foundations of the earth are shaken.<br>
    6 I said, “You are gods.<br>
    All of you are sons of the Most High.<br>
    7 Nevertheless you shall die like men,<br>
    and fall like one of the rulers.”<br>
    8 Arise, God, judge the earth,<br>
    for you inherit all of the nations.

  <h4>Psalm 83</h4>
  <p>
    1 God, don’t keep silent.<br>
    Don’t keep silent,<br>
    and don’t be still, God.<br>
    2 For behold, your enemies are stirred up.<br>
    Those who hate you have lifted up their heads.<br>
    3 They conspire with cunning against your people.<br>
    They plot against your cherished ones.<br>
    4 “Come,” they say, “let’s destroy them as a nation,<br>
    that the name of Israel may be remembered no more.”<br>
    5 For they have conspired together with one mind.<br>
    They form an alliance against you.<br>
    6 The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites;<br>
    Moab, and the Hagrites;<br>
    7 Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek;<br>
    Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;<br>
    8 Assyria also is joined with them.<br>
    They have helped the children of Lot.<br>
    Selah.<br>
    9 Do to them as you did to Midian,<br>
    as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon;<br>
    10 who perished at Endor,<br>
    who became as dung for the earth.<br>
    11 Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb;<br>
    yes, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna;<br>
    12 who said, “Let’s take possession of God’s pasturelands.”<br>
    13 My God, make them like tumbleweed,<br>
    like chaff before the wind.<br>
    14 As the fire that burns the forest,<br>
    as the flame that sets the mountains on fire,<br>
    15 so pursue them with your tempest,<br>
    and terrify them with your storm.<br>
    16 Fill their faces with confusion,<br>
    that they may seek your name, Lord.<br>
    17 Let them be disappointed and dismayed forever.<br>
    Yes, let them be confounded and perish,<br>
    18 that they may know that you alone, whose name is the Lord,<br>
    are the Most High over all the earth.

  <!-- Proverbs 17:15–28 -->
  <h3>Proverbs</h3>
  <h4>Proverbs 17:15–28</h4>
  <p>
    15 He who justifies the wicked, and he who condemns the righteous—<br>
    both of them alike are an abomination to the Lord.<br>
    16 Why is there money in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom,<br>
    since he has no understanding?<br>
    17 A friend loves at all times;<br>
    and a brother is born for adversity.<br>
    18 A man void of understanding strikes hands,<br>
    and becomes collateral in the presence of his neighbor.<br>
    19 He who loves disobedience loves strife.<br>
    One who builds a high gate seeks destruction.<br>
    20 One who has a perverse heart doesn’t find prosperity,<br>
    and one who has a deceitful tongue falls into trouble.<br>
    21 He who becomes the father of a fool grieves.<br>
    The father of a fool has no joy.<br>
    22 A cheerful heart makes good medicine,<br>
    but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.<br>
    23 A wicked man receives a bribe in secret,<br>
    to pervert the ways of justice.<br>
    24 Wisdom is before the face of one who has understanding,<br>
    but the eyes of a fool wander to the ends of the earth.<br>
    25 A foolish son brings grief to his father,<br>
    and bitterness to her who bore him.<br>
    26 Also to punish the righteous is not good,<br>
    nor to flog officials for their integrity.<br>
    27 He who spares his words has knowledge.<br>
    He who is even tempered is a man of understanding.<br>
    28 Even a fool, when he keeps silent, is counted wise.<br>
    When he shuts his lips, he is thought to be discerning.

    1 He who loves his son will frequently discipline him,<br>
    that he may rejoice in him later.<br>
    2 He who chastises his son will profit by him,<br>
    and will boast of him among acquaintances.<br>
    3 He who teaches his son will make his enemy jealous,<br>
    and will rejoice in him among friends.<br>
    4 When his father dies, it is as though he is not dead;<br>
    for he has left behind one like himself.<br>
    5 In his life, he saw and rejoiced in him.<br>
    When he died, he was not grieved.<br>
    6 He has left behind him one who avenges his enemies,<br>
    and repays his friends with thankfulness.<br>
    7 He who makes too much of his son will bind up his wounds;<br>
    his heart will be troubled at every cry.<br>
    8 A horse not broken in becomes headstrong;<br>
    and a child left to himself becomes willful.<br>
    9 Pamper your child, and he will make you afraid.<br>
    Play with him, and he will grieve you.<br>
    10 Don’t laugh with him, lest you have sorrow with him,<br>
    and you will gnash your teeth in the end.<br>
    11 Give him no liberty in his youth.<br>
    Don’t ignore his thoughts.<br>
    12 Bow down his neck in his youth,<br>
    and beat his sides while he is a child,<br>
    lest he become stubborn, and disobey you;<br>
    and there will be sorrow to your soul.<br>
    13 Discipline your son, and take pains with him,<br>
    lest his shameless behavior be an offense to you.<br>
    14 Better is a poor man who is sound and strong in constitution<br>
    than a rich man who is plagued in his body.<br>
    15 Health and fitness are better than all gold,<br>
    and a strong body than countless riches.<br>
    16 There is no wealth better than health of body,<br>
    and there is no gladness above the joy of the heart.<br>
    17 Death is better than a bitter life,<br>
    and eternal rest than continual sickness.<br>
    18 Good things poured out upon a mouth that is closed<br>
    are like offerings of food laid upon a grave.<br>
    19 What good does an offering to an idol profit?<br>
    For neither can it eat nor smell.<br>
    So is he who is afflicted by the Lord,<br>
    seeing with his eyes and groaning,<br>
    like a eunuch embracing a virgin and groaning.<br>
    20 Don’t give your soul to sorrow.<br>
    Don’t afflict yourself deliberately.<br>
    21 Cheer up your heart, and comfort yourself.<br>
    Keep sorrow far from you,<br>
    for sorrow has destroyed many,<br>
    and there is no profit in it.<br>
    22 Envy and wrath shorten a man’s days.<br>
    Anxiety brings old age before the time.<br>
    23 A cheerful and good heart will care for his food.<br>
    He will eat and enjoy it.

    3 When wickedness comes, contempt also comes,<br>

    6 A fool’s lips come into strife,<br>

    7 A fool’s mouth is his destruction,<br>
    and his lips are a snare to his soul.<br>
    8 The words of a gossip are like dainty morsels:<br>
    they go down into a person’s innermost parts.<br>

    and he does not breathe heavily on his bed.<br>
    20 Healthy sleeping comes from moderate eating.<br>
    He rises early, and his wits are with him.<br>
    The pain of sleeplessness and nausea and colic are with an insatiable man.<br>
    21 If you are forced to eat, arise, go out, vomit, and you will have rest.<br>
    22 Listen to me, my son, and don’t despise me.<br>
    In the end, you will find my words to be true.<br>
    In all your works be quick,<br>
    and no disease will come to you.<br>
    23 The generous man will bless his soul,<br>
    and the merciful man will see a blessing.<br>
    24 Those who are cruel to themselves, to whom will they be good?<br>
    They will not rejoice in their own blessings.<br>
    25 If one is mean to himself, to whom will he be generous?<br>
    He will not enjoy his own riches.<br>
    26 No one is worse than he who is grudging to himself.<br>
    This is the punishment for his wickedness;<br>
    27 and if he does good, he does it in forgetfulness;<br>
    and in the end he shows his wickedness.<br>
    28 The miser’s eye is evil toward bread,<br>
    and he complains in his own table.<br>
    29 My son, according to what you have, do good to yourself,<br>
    and offer to the Lord worthy offerings.<br>
    30 Remember that death will not wait,<br>
    and the covenant of Hades hasn’t been shown to you.<br>
    31 Do good to your friend before you die,<br>
    and reach out and give to him according to your ability.<br>
    32 Don’t defraud yourself of a good day;<br>
    don’t let any part of a good desire pass you by.<br>
    33 Won’t you leave all your labors to another,<br>
    and your toils to be divided by lot?<br>
    34 Give, and take, and sanctify your soul;<br>
    for there is no seeking of luxuries in the grave.

  <h3>Psalms</h3>

  <h4>Psalm 87</h4>
  <p>
    1 His foundation is in the holy mountains.<br>
    2 The Lord loves the gates of Zion<br>
    more than all the dwellings of Jacob.<br>
    3 Glorious things are spoken about you, city of God.<br>
    Selah.<br>
    4 I will record Rahab and Babylon among those who acknowledge me.<br>
    Behold, Philistia, Tyre, and also Ethiopia:<br>
    “This one was born there.”<br>
    5 Yes, of Zion it will be said, “This one and that one was born in her,”<br>
    the Most High himself will establish her.<br>
    6 The Lord will count, when he writes up the peoples,<br>
    “This one was born there.”<br>
    Selah.<br>
    7 Those who sing as well as those who dance say,<br>
    “All my springs are in you.”
  </p>

  <h4>Psalm 88</h4>
  <p>
    1 Lord, the God of my salvation,<br>
    I have cried day and night before you.<br>
    2 Let my prayer enter into your presence.<br>
    Turn your ear to my cry.<br>
    3 For my soul is full of troubles.<br>
    My life draws near to Sheol.<br>
    4 I am counted among those who go down into the pit.<br>
    I am like a man who has no help,<br>
    5 set apart among the dead,<br>
    like the slain who lie in the grave,<br>
    whom you remember no more.<br>
    They are cut off from your hand.<br>
    6 You have laid me in the lowest pit,<br>
    in the darkest depths.<br>
    7 Your wrath lies heavily on me.<br>
    You have afflicted me with all your waves.<br>
    Selah.<br>
    8 You have taken my friends from me.<br>
    You have made me an abomination to them.<br>
    I am confined, and I can’t escape.<br>
    9 My eyes are dim from grief.<br>
    I have called on you daily, Lord.<br>
    I have spread out my hands to you.<br>
    10 Do you show wonders to the dead?<br>
    Do the departed spirits rise up and praise you?<br>
    Selah.<br>
    11 Is your loving kindness declared in the grave?<br>
    Or your faithfulness in Destruction?<br>
    12 Are your wonders made known in the dark?<br>
    Or your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?<br>
    13 But to you, Lord, I have cried.<br>
    In the morning, my prayer comes before you.<br>
    14 Lord, why do you reject my soul?<br>
    Why do you hide your face from me?<br>
    15 I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up.<br>
    While I suffer your terrors, I am distracted.<br>
    16 Your fierce wrath has gone over me.<br>
    Your terrors have cut me off.<br>
    17 They came around me like water all day long.<br>
    They completely engulfed me.<br>
    18 You have put lover and friend far from me,<br>
    and my friends into darkness.

  <h3>Proverbs</h3>
  <h4>Proverbs 18:13–24</h4>
  <p>
    13 He who answers before he hears,<br>
    that is folly and shame to him.<br>
    14 A man’s spirit will sustain him in sickness,<br>
    but a crushed spirit, who can bear?<br>
    15 The heart of the discerning gets knowledge.<br>
    The ear of the wise seeks knowledge.<br>
    16 A man’s gift makes room for him,<br>
    and brings him before great men.<br>
    17 He who pleads his cause first seems right;<br>
    until another comes and questions him.<br>
    18 The lot settles disputes,<br>
    and keeps strong ones apart.<br>
    19 A brother offended is more difficult than a fortified city.<br>
    Disputes are like the bars of a fortress.<br>
    20 A man’s stomach is filled with the fruit of his mouth.<br>
    With the harvest of his lips he is satisfied.<br>
    21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue;<br>
    those who love it will eat its fruit.<br>
    22 Whoever finds a wife finds a good thing,<br>
    and obtains favor of the Lord.<br>
    23 The poor plead for mercy,<br>
    but the rich answer harshly.<br>
    24 A man of many companions may be ruined,<br>
    but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.

  <p>
    1 Have they made you ruler over a feast?<br>
    Don’t exalt yourself.<br>
    Be among them as one of them.<br>
    Take good care of them, and then be seated.<br>
    2 When you have done all your duties, take your place,<br>
    that you may be merry with them,<br>
    and receive a crown for your well ordering.<br>
    3 Speak, you who are older, for it is proper to you,<br>
    but with sound knowledge,<br>
    and don’t interrupt the music.<br>
    4 Where there is no one who listens, don’t pour out talk.<br>
    Don’t show off your wisdom out of time.<br>
    5 A concert of music in a banquet of wine is like a signet of emerald set in gold.<br>
    6 A concert of music in a banquet of wine is like a seal of emerald set in gold.<br>
    7 Speak, you who are young, if you are obliged,<br>
    and not more than twice, and only if asked.<br>
    8 Summarize your speech. Many things in few words.<br>
    Be as one who knows and yet holds his tongue.<br>
    9 Don’t be hasty in your words in a crowd.<br>
    Don’t lay your wisdom out of place.<br>
    10 A ruby seal on a precious stone is a concert of music in a banquet of wine.<br>
    11 Speak, young man, if there is need of you;<br>
    yet scarcely when you are twice asked.<br>
    12 Summarize your speech. Many things in few words.<br>
    Be as one who knows and yet is silent.<br>
    13 In company of great men, don’t be forward.<br>
    Don’t speak much.<br>
    14 Lightning goes before thunder.<br>
    Favor goes before a modest man.<br>
    15 Rise up early, and don’t be the last;<br>
    get home quickly without delay.<br>
    16 There take your pastime,<br>
    and do what is in your heart;<br>
    but don’t sin by proud speech.<br>
    17 Above all, bless your Maker,<br>
    who fills you with his good gifts.<br>
    18 He who fears the Lord will receive his discipline.<br>
    Those who seek him early will find favor.<br>
    19 He who seeks the law will be filled with it,<br>
    but the hypocrite will stumble at it.<br>
    20 Those who fear the Lord will find judgment,<br>
    and will kindle righteous acts like a light.<br>
    21 A sinful man shuns reproof,<br>
    and finds an excuse according to his will.<br>
    22 A man of counsel will not neglect thought;<br>
    a strange and proud man will not be daunted by fear.<br>
    23 Do nothing without counsel;<br>
    and when you have done it, don’t be sorry.<br>
    24 Don’t go in a way of conflict,<br>
    and don’t stumble at the stones.<br>
    25 Don’t trust on a smooth road,<br>
    and be careful in your paths.<br>
    26 And be aware of your children, and heed them,<br>
    and watch over them with sure discipline.<br>
    27 He who trusts the law gives heed to the commandments.<br>
    He who trusts the Lord will never suffer loss.

  <h3>Psalms</h3>

  <h4>Psalm 89</h4>
  <p>
    1 I will sing of the loving kindness of the Lord forever.<br>
    With my mouth, I will make known your faithfulness to all generations.<br>
    2 I indeed declare, “Love stands firm forever.<br>
    You established the heavens.<br>
    Your faithfulness is in them.”<br>
    3 “I have made a covenant with my chosen one.<br>
    I have sworn to David, my servant,<br>
    4 ‘I will establish your offspring forever,<br>
    and build up your throne to all generations.’”<br>
    Selah.<br>
    5 The heavens will praise your wonders, Lord;<br>
    your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.<br>
    6 For who in the skies can be compared to the Lord?<br>
    Who among the sons of the heavenly beings is like the Lord,<br>
    7 a very awesome God in the council of the holy ones,<br>
    to be feared above all those who are around him?<br>
    8 Lord, God of Armies, who is a mighty one, like you?<br>
    The Lord, your faithfulness is around you.<br>
    9 You rule the pride of the sea.<br>
    When its waves rise up, you calm them.<br>
    10 You have broken Rahab in pieces, like one of the slain.<br>
    You have scattered your enemies with your mighty arm.<br>
    11 The heavens are yours. The earth also is yours,<br>
    the world and its fullness. You have founded them.<br>
    12 You have created the north and the south.<br>
    Tabor and Hermon rejoice in your name.<br>
    13 You have a mighty arm.<br>
    Your hand is strong, and your right hand is exalted.<br>
    14 Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne.<br>
    Loving kindness and truth go before your face.<br>
    15 Blessed are the people who learn to acclaim you.<br>
    They walk in the light of your presence, Lord.<br>
    16 In your name they rejoice all day.<br>
    In your righteousness, they are exalted.<br>
    17 For you are the glory of their strength.<br>
    In your favor, our horn will be exalted.<br>
    18 For our shield belongs to the Lord,<br>
    our king to the Holy One of Israel.<br>
    19 Then you spoke in vision to your saints,<br>
    and said, “I have given strength to the warrior.<br>
    I have exalted a young man from the people.<br>
    20 I have found David, my servant.<br>
    I have anointed him with my holy oil,<br>
    21 with whom my hand shall be established.<br>
    My arm will also strengthen him.<br>
    22 No enemy will tax him.<br>
    No wicked man will oppress him.<br>
    23 I will beat down his adversaries before him,<br>
    and strike those who hate him.<br>
    24 But my faithfulness and my loving kindness will be with him.<br>
    In my name, his horn will be exalted.<br>
    25 I will set his hand also on the sea,<br>
    and his right hand on the rivers.<br>
    26 He will call to me, ‘You are my Father,<br>
    my God, and the rock of my salvation!’<br>
    27 I will also appoint him my firstborn,<br>
    the highest of the kings of the earth.<br>
    28 I will keep my loving kindness for him forever more.<br>
    My covenant will stand firm with him.<br>
    29 I will also make his offspring endure forever,<br>
    and his throne as the days of heaven.<br>
    30 If his children forsake my law,<br>
    and don’t walk in my ordinances;<br>
    31 if they break my statutes,<br>
    and don’t keep my commandments;<br>
    32 then I will punish their sin with the rod,<br>
    and their iniquity with stripes.<br>
    33 But I will not completely take my loving kindness from him,<br>
    nor allow my faithfulness to fail.<br>
    34 I will not break my covenant,<br>
    nor alter what my lips have uttered.<br>
    35 Once I have sworn by my holiness,<br>
    I will not lie to David.<br>
    36 His offspring will endure forever,<br>
    his throne like the sun before me.<br>
    37 It will be established forever like the moon,<br>
    the faithful witness in the sky.”<br>
    Selah.<br>
    38 But you have rejected and spurned.<br>
    You have been angry with your anointed.<br>
    39 You have renounced the covenant of your servant.<br>
    You have defiled his crown in the dust.<br>
    40 You have broken down all his hedges.<br>
    You have brought his strongholds to ruin.<br>
    41 All who pass by the way rob him.<br>
    He has become a reproach to his neighbors.<br>
    42 You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries.<br>
    You have made all of his enemies rejoice.<br>
    43 Yes, you turn back the edge of his sword,<br>
    and haven’t supported him in battle.<br>
    44 You have ended his splendor,<br>
    and thrown his throne down to the ground.<br>
    45 You have shortened the days of his youth.<br>
    You have covered him with shame.<br>
    Selah.<br>
    46 How long, Lord?<br>
    Will you hide yourself forever?<br>
    Will your wrath burn like fire?<br>
    47 Remember how short my time is;<br>
    for what vanity you have created all the children of men!<br>
    48 What man is he who shall live and not see death,<br>
    who shall deliver his soul from the power of Sheol?<br>
    Selah.<br>
    49 Lord, where are your former loving kindnesses,<br>
    which you swore to David in your faithfulness?<br>
    50 Remember, Lord, the reproach of your servants,<br>
    how I bear in my heart the taunts of all the mighty peoples,<br>
    51 With which your enemies have mocked, Lord,<br>
    with which they have mocked the footsteps of your anointed one.<br>
    52 Blessed be the Lord forever more.<br>
    Amen and Amen.

    1 Better is the poor who walks in integrity<br>
    than he who is perverse in his lips and is a fool.<br>
    2 It isn’t good to have zeal without knowledge,<br>
    nor being hasty with one’s feet and missing the way.<br>
    3 The foolishness of man subverts his way;<br>
    his heart rages against the Lord.<br>
    4 Wealth adds many friends,<br>
    but the poor is separated from his friend.<br>
    5 A false witness shall not be unpunished.<br>
    He who pours out lies shall not go free.<br>
    6 Many will entreat the favor of a ruler,<br>
    and everyone is a friend to a man who gives gifts.<br>
    7 All the relatives of the poor shun him.<br>
    How much more do his friends avoid him?<br>
    He pursues them with pleas, but they are gone.<br>
    8 He who gets wisdom loves his own soul.<br>

    10 Delicate living is not appropriate for a fool,<br>

  <h4>Psalm 90</h4>
  <p>
    1 Lord, you have been our dwelling place<br>
    for all generations.<br>
    2 Before the mountains were brought forth,<br>
    before you had formed the earth and the world,<br>
    even from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.<br>
    3 You turn man to destruction, saying,<br>
    “Return, you children of men.”<br>
    4 For a thousand years in your sight<br>
    are just like yesterday when it is past,<br>
    like a watch in the night.<br>
    5 You sweep them away as they sleep.<br>
    In the morning they sprout like new grass.<br>
    6 In the morning it sprouts and springs up.<br>
    By evening it is withered and dry.<br>
    7 For we are consumed in your anger.<br>
    We are troubled in your wrath.<br>
    8 You have set our iniquities before you,<br>
    our secret sins in the light of your presence.<br>
    9 For all our days have passed away in your wrath.<br>
    We bring our years to an end as a sigh.<br>
    10 The days of our years are seventy,<br>
    or even by reason of strength eighty years;<br>
    yet their pride is but labor and sorrow,<br>
    for it passes quickly, and we fly away.<br>
    11 Who knows the power of your anger,<br>
    your wrath according to the fear that is due to you?<br>
    12 So teach us to number our days,<br>
    that we may gain a heart of wisdom.<br>
    13 Relent, Lord! How long?<br>
    Have compassion on your servants!<br>
    14 Satisfy us in the morning with your loving kindness,<br>
    that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.<br>
    15 Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us,<br>
    for as many years as we have seen evil.<br>
    16 Let your work appear to your servants,<br>
    your glory to their children.<br>
    17 Let the favor of the Lord our God be on us.<br>
    Establish the work of our hands for us.<br>
    Yes, establish the work of our hands.

  <h4>Psalm 91</h4>
  <p>
    1 He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High<br>
    will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.<br>
    2 I will say of the Lord, “He is my refuge and my fortress;<br>
    my God, in whom I trust.”<br>
    3 For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler,<br>
    and from the deadly pestilence.<br>
    4 He will cover you with his feathers.<br>
    Under his wings you will take refuge.<br>
    His faithfulness is your shield and rampart.<br>
    5 You shall not be afraid of the terror by night,<br>
    nor of the arrow that flies by day,<br>
    6 nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness,<br>
    nor of the destruction that wastes at noonday.<br>
    7 A thousand may fall at your side,<br>
    and ten thousand at your right hand;<br>
    but it will not come near you.<br>
    8 You will only look with your eyes,<br>
    and see the recompense of the wicked.<br>
    9 Because you have made the Lord your refuge,<br>
    and the Most High your dwelling place,<br>
    10 no evil shall happen to you,<br>
    neither shall any plague come near your dwelling.<br>
    11 For he will put his angels in charge of you,<br>
    to guard you in all your ways.<br>
    12 They will bear you up in their hands,<br>
    so that you won’t dash your foot against a stone.<br>
    13 You will tread on the lion and cobra.<br>
    You will trample the young lion and the serpent underfoot.<br>
    14 “Because he has set his love on me, therefore I will deliver him.<br>
    I will set him on high, because he has known my name.<br>
    15 He will call on me, and I will answer him.<br>
    I will be with him in trouble.<br>
    I will deliver him, and honor him.<br>
    16 I will satisfy him with long life,<br>
    and show him my salvation.”

  <h4>Psalm 92</h4>
  <p>
    1 It is a good thing to give thanks to the Lord,<br>
    to sing praises to your name, Most High;<br>
    2 to proclaim your loving kindness in the morning,<br>
    and your faithfulness every night,<br>
    3 with the ten-stringed lute, with the harp,<br>
    and with the melody of the lyre.<br>
    4 For you, Lord, have made me glad through your work.<br>
    I will triumph in the works of your hands.<br>
    5 How great are your works, Lord!<br>
    Your thoughts are very deep.<br>
    6 A senseless man doesn’t know,<br>
    neither does a fool understand this:<br>
    7 though the wicked spring up like grass,<br>
    and all evildoers flourish,<br>
    they will be destroyed forever.<br>
    8 But you, Lord, are on high forever more.<br>
    9 For behold, your enemies, Lord,<br>
    for behold, your enemies shall perish.<br>
    All the evildoers will be scattered.<br>
    10 But you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox.<br>
    I am anointed with fresh oil.<br>
    11 My eye has also seen my enemies.<br>
    My ears have heard of the wicked enemies who rise up against me.<br>
    12 The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree.<br>
    He will grow like a cedar in Lebanon.<br>
    13 They are planted in the Lord’s house.<br>
    They will flourish in our God’s courts.<br>
    14 They will still produce fruit in old age.<br>
    They will be full of sap and green,<br>
    15 to show that the Lord is upright.<br>
    He is my rock,<br>
    and there is no unrighteousness in him.

    A poor man is better than a liar.<br>
    23 The fear of the Lord leads to life, then contentment;<br>
    he rests and will not be touched by trouble.<br>
    24 The sluggard buries his hand in the dish;<br>
    he will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.<br>
    25 Flog a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence;<br>
    rebuke one who has understanding, and he will gain knowledge.<br>
    26 He who robs his father and drives away his mother<br>
    is a son who causes shame and brings reproach.<br>
    27 If you stop listening to instruction, my son,<br>
    you will stray from the words of knowledge.<br>
    28 A corrupt witness mocks justice,<br>
    and the mouth of the wicked gulps down iniquity.<br>
    29 Penalties are prepared for scoffers,<br>
    and beatings for the backs of fools.

  <p>
    1 No evil will happen to him who fears the Lord;<br>
    but in temptation, once and again he will deliver him.<br>
    2 A wise man won’t hate the law,<br>
    but he who is a hypocrite about it is like a ship in a storm.<br>
    3 A man of understanding will put his trust in the law.<br>
    The law is as dependable to him as an inquiry by Urim.<br>
    4 Prepare your speech, and so you will be heard.<br>
    Bind up instruction, and make your answer.<br>
    5 The heart of a fool is like a cartwheel;<br>
    and his thoughts like a rolling axle.<br>
    6 A stallion horse is like a mocking friend;<br>
    he neighs under everyone who sits on him.<br>
    7 Why does one day excel another,<br>
    when all the light of every day in the year is of the sun?<br>
    8 By the Lord’s wisdom they were distinguished;<br>
    and he varied the seasons and festivals.<br>
    9 Some of them he exalted and hallowed,<br>
    and some of them he made ordinary days.<br>
    10 All men are from the ground,<br>
    and Adam was created of earth.<br>
    11 In the fullness of knowledge the Lord distinguished them,<br>
    and made their ways various.<br>
    12 Some of them he blessed and lifted up,<br>
    and some of them he hallowed and brought near to himself.<br>
    Some of them he cursed and brought low,<br>
    and overthrew them from their place.<br>
    13 Like clay in the hand of the potter,<br>
    all his ways are according to his good pleasure;<br>
    so men in the hand of him who made them,<br>
    to render to them according to his judgment.<br>
    14 Good is set against evil,<br>
    and life against death;<br>
    so the sinner against the godly.<br>
    15 So look upon all the works of the Most High:<br>
    two and two, one against another.<br>
    16 I awakened up last, like one who gathers after the grape gatherers.<br>
    By the blessing of the Lord I profited,<br>
    and filled my winepress like one who gathers grapes.<br>
    17 Consider that I haven’t labored for myself only,<br>
    but for all those who seek instruction.<br>
    18 Hear me, you great men of the people,<br>
    and hearken with your ears, you rulers of the congregation.<br>
    19 To son or wife, to brother or friend,<br>
    don’t give power over yourself while you live.<br>
    Don’t give your goods to another,<br>
    lest you ask for them again and not get them.<br>
    20 As long as you live and have breath in you,<br>
    don’t give yourself over to anybody.<br>
    21 For it is better that your children should ask of you,<br>
    than that you should look toward the hand of your sons.<br>
    22 In all your works keep the upper hand.<br>
    Don’t stain your honor.<br>
    23 In the day that you end the days of your life,<br>
    in the time of death, distribute your inheritance.<br>
    24 Fodder, a rod, and burdens are for the donkey;<br>
    bread, discipline, and work for a servant.<br>
    25 Set your servant to work, and you will find rest.<br>
    Leave his hands idle, and he will seek liberty.<br>
    26 Yoke and thong will bow the neck;<br>
    and for an evil servant, there are racks and tortures.<br>
    27 Send him to labor, that he not be idle;<br>
    for idleness teaches much evil.<br>
    28 Set him to work, as is fitting for him.<br>
    If he doesn’t obey, make his fetters heavy.<br>
    But don’t be excessive toward anyone,<br>
    and don’t do anything without judgment.<br>
    29 If you have a servant, let him be as yourself,<br>
    because you have bought him with blood.<br>
    30 If you have a servant, treat him as a brother,<br>
    for you need him as for your own soul.<br>
    If you treat him badly, and he runs away,<br>
    which way will you go to seek him?

  <h3>Psalms</h3>

  <h4>Psalm 93</h4>
  <p>
    1 The Lord reigns! He is clothed with majesty!<br>
    The Lord is armed with strength.<br>
    The world also is established.<br>
    It can’t be moved.<br>
    2 Your throne is established from long ago.<br>
    You are from everlasting.<br>
    3 The floods have lifted up, Lord,<br>
    the floods have lifted up their voice.<br>
    The floods lift up their waves.<br>
    4 Above the voices of many waters,<br>
    the mighty breakers of the sea,<br>
    the Lord on high is mighty.<br>
    5 Your statutes stand firm.<br>
    Holiness adorns your house,<br>
    Lord, forever more.
  </p>

  <h4>Psalm 94</h4>
  <p>
    1 The Lord is a God who avenges.<br>
    God who avenges, shine out.<br>
    2 Rise up, you judge of the earth.<br>
    Pay back the proud what they deserve.<br>
    3 Lord, how long will the wicked,<br>
    how long will the wicked triumph?<br>
    4 They pour out arrogant words.<br>
    All the evildoers boast.<br>
    5 They break your people in pieces, Lord,<br>
    and afflict your heritage.<br>
    6 They kill the widow and the alien,<br>
    and murder the fatherless.<br>
    7 They say, “The Lord will not see,<br>
    neither will Jacob’s God consider.”<br>
    8 Consider, you senseless among the people;<br>
    you fools, when will you be wise?<br>
    9 He who implanted the ear, won’t he hear?<br>
    He who formed the eye, won’t he see?<br>
    10 He who disciplines the nations, won’t he punish?<br>
    He who teaches man knows.<br>
    11 The Lord knows the thoughts of man,<br>
    that they are futile.<br>
    12 Blessed is the man whom you discipline, Lord,<br>
    and teach out of your law,<br>
    13 that you may give him rest from the days of adversity,<br>
    until the pit is dug for the wicked.<br>
    14 For the Lord won’t reject his people,<br>
    neither will he forsake his inheritance.<br>
    15 For judgment will return to righteousness.<br>
    All the upright in heart shall follow it.<br>
    16 Who will rise up for me against the wicked?<br>
    Who will stand up for me against the evildoers?<br>
    17 Unless the Lord had been my help,<br>
    my soul would have soon lived in silence.<br>
    18 When I said, “My foot is slipping!”<br>
    Your loving kindness, Lord, held me up.<br>
    19 In the multitude of my thoughts within me,<br>
    your comforts delight my soul.<br>
    20 Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with you,<br>
    which brings about mischief by statute?<br>
    21 They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous,<br>
    and condemn the innocent blood.<br>
    22 But the Lord has been my high tower;<br>
    my God, the rock of my refuge.<br>
    23 He has brought on them their own iniquity,<br>
    and will cut them off in their own wickedness.<br>
    The Lord our God will cut them off.

  <h4>Psalm 95</h4>
  <p>
    1 Oh come, let’s sing to the Lord.<br>
    Let’s shout aloud to the rock of our salvation!<br>
    2 Let’s come before his presence with thanksgiving.<br>
    Let’s extol him with songs!<br>
    3 For the Lord is a great God,<br>
    a great King above all gods.<br>
    4 In his hand are the deep places of the earth.<br>
    The heights of the mountains are also his.<br>
    5 The sea is his, and he made it.<br>
    His hands formed the dry land.<br>
    6 Oh come, let’s worship and bow down.<br>
    Let’s kneel before the Lord, our Maker,<br>
    7 for he is our God.<br>
    We are the people of his pasture,<br>
    and the sheep in his care.<br>
    Today, oh that you would hear his voice!<br>
    8 Don’t harden your heart, as at Meribah,<br>
    as in the day of Massah in the wilderness,<br>
    9 when your fathers tempted me,<br>
    tested me, and saw my work.<br>
    10 Forty long years I was grieved with that generation, and said,<br>
    “It is a people that errs in their heart.<br>
    They have not known my ways.”<br>
    11 Therefore I swore in my wrath,<br>
    “They won’t enter into my rest.”

  <p>
    1 Wine is a mocker and beer is a brawler.<br>
    Whoever is led astray by them is not wise.<br>
    2 The terror of a king is like the roaring of a lion.<br>
    He who provokes him to anger forfeits his own life.<br>
    3 It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife,<br>
    but every fool will be quarreling.<br>
    4 The sluggard will not plow by reason of the winter;<br>
    therefore he shall beg in harvest, and have nothing.<br>
    5 Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water,<br>
    but a man of understanding will draw it out.<br>
    6 Many men claim to be men of unfailing love,<br>
    but who can find a faithful man?<br>
    7 A righteous man walks in integrity.<br>
    Blessed are his children after him.<br>
    8 A king who sits on the throne of judgment<br>
    scatters away all evil with his eyes.<br>
    9 Who can say, “I have made my heart pure.<br>
    I am clean and without sin?”<br>
    10 Differing weights and differing measures,<br>
    both of them alike are an abomination to the Lord.<br>
    11 Even a child makes himself known by his doings,<br>
    whether his work is pure, and whether it is right.<br>
    12 The hearing ear, and the seeing eye,<br>
    the Lord has made even both of them.<br>
    13 Don’t love sleep, lest you come to poverty.<br>
    Open your eyes, and you shall be satisfied with bread.<br>
    14 “It’s no good, it’s no good,” says the buyer;<br>
    but when he has gone his way, then he boasts.<br>
    15 There is gold and abundance of rubies;<br>
    but the lips of knowledge are a rare jewel.

    1 Vain and false hopes are for a man void of understanding;<br>
    and dreams give wings to fools.<br>
    2 As one who catches at a shadow and follows after the wind,<br>
    so is he who sets his mind on dreams.<br>
    3 The vision of dreams is like a reflection of a face in a mirror;<br>
    the likeness of a face against a face.<br>
    4 From an unclean thing what will be cleansed?<br>
    From that which is false what will be true?<br>
    5 Divinations, and soothsayings, and dreams, are vain;<br>
    and the heart fancies, as a woman’s in travail.<br>
    6 If they are not sent from the Most High in your visitation,<br>
    don’t give your heart to them.<br>
    7 For dreams have led many astray.<br>
    They have failed by putting their hope in them.<br>
    8 Without deceit the law will be fulfilled,<br>
    and wisdom is perfection to a faithful mouth.<br>
    9 A well-instructed man knows many things;<br>
    and one with much experience will declare understanding.<br>
    10 He who has no experience knows few things;<br>
    but he who has traveled will increase delicacy.<br>
    11 I have seen many things in my travels,<br>
    and I understand more than I can express.<br>
    12 I was often in danger of death,<br>
    but I was delivered because of these things.<br>
    13 The spirit of those who fear the Lord shall live,<br>
    for their hope is in him who saves them.<br>
    14 He who fears the Lord won’t be afraid,<br>
    and he will not play the coward, for he is his hope.<br>
    15 Blessed is the soul of him who fears the Lord.<br>
    To whom does he look? Who is his support?<br>
    16 The eyes of the Lord are upon those who love him;<br>
    he is their mighty protection and strong support,<br>
    a cover from the scorching wind, and a cover from the noonday sun,<br>
    a guard from stumbling, and a help from falling.<br>
    17 He raises up the soul, and enlightens the eyes.<br>
    He gives health, life, and blessing.<br>
    18 He who sacrifices a thing wrongfully gotten,<br>
    his offering is made in mockery.<br>
    The gifts of the lawless are not accepted.<br>
    19 The Most High is not pleased with the offerings of the ungodly;<br>
    neither is he pacified for sins by the multitude of sacrifices.<br>
    20 He who offers a sacrifice of the goods of the poor<br>
    is like one who kills the son before his father’s eyes.<br>
    21 The bread of the needy is the life of the poor;<br>
    he who deprives him of it is a man of blood.<br>
    22 He who takes away his neighbor’s living slays him;<br>
    and he who defrauds the laborer of his hire is a bloodshedder.<br>
    23 When one builds, and another pulls down,<br>
    what profit do they have but labor?<br>
    24 When one prays, and another curses,<br>
    whose voice will the Lord listen to?<br>
    25 He who washes himself after touching a dead body, then touches it again,<br>
    what did he gain by his washing?<br>
    26 Even so a man who fasts for his sins,<br>
    and goes again and does the same,<br>
    who will listen to his prayer?<br>
    What profit does he get in humbling himself?

    Worship at his footstool.<br>
    He is Holy!<br>
    6 Moses and Aaron were among his priests,<br>
    Samuel among those who call on his name;<br>
    they called on the Lord, and he answered them.<br>
    7 He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud.<br>
    They kept his testimonies,<br>
    the statute that he gave them.<br>
    8 You answered them, Lord our God.<br>
    You were a God who forgave them,<br>
    although you took vengeance for their doings.<br>
    9 Exalt the Lord, our God.<br>
    Worship at his holy hill,<br>
    for the Lord, our God, is Holy!

    1 Shout for joy to the Lord, all you lands!<br>
    2 Serve the Lord with gladness.<br>
    Come before his presence with singing.<br>
    3 Know that the Lord, he is God.<br>
    It is he who has made us, and we are his.<br>
    We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.<br>
    4 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving,<br>
    into his courts with praise.<br>
    Give thanks to him, and bless his name.<br>
    5 For the Lord is good.<br>
    His loving kindness endures forever,<br>
    his faithfulness to all generations.

  <h4>Psalm 101</h4>
  <p>
    1 I will sing of loving kindness and justice.<br>
    To you, Lord, I will sing praises.<br>
    2 I will be careful to live a blameless life.<br>
    When will you come to me?<br>
    I will walk within my house with a blameless heart.<br>
    3 I will set no vile thing before my eyes.<br>
    I hate the deeds of faithless men.<br>
    They will not cling to me.<br>
    4 A perverse heart will be far from me.<br>
    I will have nothing to do with evil.<br>
    5 I will silence whoever secretly slanders his neighbor.<br>
    I won’t tolerate one who is arrogant and conceited.<br>
    6 My eyes will be on the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me.<br>
    He who walks in a perfect way, he will serve me.<br>
    7 He who practices deceit won’t dwell within my house.<br>
    He who speaks falsehood won’t be established before my eyes.<br>
    8 Morning by morning, I will destroy all the wicked of the land,<br>
    to cut off all the workers of iniquity from the Lord’s city.

  <h3>Proverbs</h3>
  <h4>Proverbs 21:1–15</h4>
  <p>
    1 The king’s heart is in the Lord’s hand like the watercourses.<br>
    He turns it wherever he desires.<br>
    2 Every way of a man is right in his own eyes,<br>
    but the Lord weighs the hearts.<br>
    3 To do righteousness and justice<br>
    is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice.<br>
    4 A high look and a proud heart—<br>
    the lamp of the wicked—is sin.<br>
    5 The plans of the diligent surely lead to profit;<br>
    and everyone who is hasty surely rushes to poverty.<br>
    6 Getting treasures by a lying tongue<br>
    is a fleeting vapor for those who seek death.<br>
    7 The violence of the wicked will drive them away,<br>
    because they refuse to do what is right.<br>
    8 The way of the guilty is devious,<br>
    but the conduct of the innocent is upright.<br>
    9 It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop<br>
    than to share a house with a contentious woman.<br>
    10 The soul of the wicked desires evil;<br>
    his neighbor finds no mercy in his eyes.<br>
    11 When the mocker is punished, the simple gains wisdom.<br>
    When the wise is instructed, he receives knowledge.<br>
    12 The Righteous One considers the house of the wicked,<br>
    and brings the wicked to ruin.<br>
    13 Whoever stops his ears at the cry of the poor,<br>
    he will also cry out, but shall not be heard.<br>
    14 A gift in secret pacifies anger;<br>
    and a bribe in the cloak, strong wrath.<br>
    15 It is joy to the righteous to do justice,<br>
    but it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity.

  <p>
    1 Have mercy upon us, O Lord, the God of all, and behold;<br>
    2 and send your fear upon all the nations.<br>
    3 Lift up your hand against the foreign nations,<br>
    that they may see your mighty power.<br>
    4 As you were sanctified in us before them,<br>
    so be you magnified among them before us.<br>
    5 Let them know you, as we have known you,<br>
    that there is no God but you, O God.<br>
    6 Show new signs, and make more wonders;<br>
    glorify your hand and your right arm.<br>
    7 Raise up your indignation, and pour out wrath;<br>
    take away the adversary, and destroy the enemy.<br>
    8 Speedily give an end to the time, remember the covenant,<br>
    that they may declare your mighty deeds.<br>
    9 Let him who escapes be devoured by the rage of fire;<br>

    11 Gather all the tribes of Jacob together,<br>

    12 O Lord, have mercy upon the people that is called by your name,<br>
    and upon Israel, whom you named your firstborn.<br>
    13 Be merciful to Jerusalem, the city of your sanctuary,<br>
    the place of your rest.<br>
    14 Fill Zion with your majesty,<br>
    and your temple with your glory.<br>
    15 Give testimony to those who were your creatures in the beginning,<br>
    and fulfill the prophecies that have been spoken in your name.<br>
    16 Give reward to those who wait for you,<br>
    and men will put their trust in your prophets.<br>
    17 Hear the prayer of your servants,<br>
    according to the blessing of Aaron concerning your people;<br>
    and all those who are on the earth will know<br>
    that you are the Lord, the eternal God.<br>
    18 The belly will eat any kind of food,<br>
    yet one food is better than another.<br>
    19 As the palate tastes the flavors of venison,<br>
    so does a skillful heart discern false speeches.<br>
    20 A perverse heart will cause heaviness,<br>
    but a man of experience will repay him.<br>
    21 A woman will receive any man,<br>
    but one daughter is better than another.<br>
    22 The beauty of a woman makes her face shine,<br>
    and above all desire she is desired.<br>
    23 If there is on her tongue mercy and meekness,<br>
    her husband is not like the sons of men.<br>
    24 He who gets a wife enters upon a possession,<br>
    a help like himself, and a pillar of rest.<br>
    25 Where no hedge is, the property is plundered.<br>
    He who has no wife will wander, mourning.<br>
    26 Who will trust a well-equipped robber,<br>
    who skips from city to city?<br>
    Likewise a man who has no nest,<br>
    and lodges wherever night overtakes him.

  <h4>Psalm 102</h4>
  <p>
    1 Hear my prayer, Lord!<br>
    Let my cry come to you.<br>
    2 Don’t hide your face from me in the day of my distress.<br>
    Turn your ear to me.<br>
    Answer me quickly in the day when I call.<br>
    3 For my days consume away like smoke.<br>
    My bones are burned as a torch.<br>
    4 My heart is blighted like grass, and withered;<br>
    for I forget to eat my bread.<br>
    5 By reason of the voice of my groaning,<br>
    my bones stick to my skin.<br>
    6 I am like a pelican of the wilderness.<br>
    I have become as an owl of the waste places.<br>
    7 I watch, and have become like a sparrow that is alone on the housetop.<br>
    8 My enemies reproach me all day.<br>
    Those who are mad at me use my name as a curse.<br>
    9 For I have eaten ashes like bread,<br>
    and mixed my drink with tears,<br>
    10 because of your indignation and your wrath;<br>
    for you have taken me up, and thrown me away.<br>
    11 My days are like a long shadow.<br>
    I have withered like grass.<br>
    12 But you, Lord, will remain forever;<br>
    your renown endures to all generations.<br>
    13 You will arise and have mercy on Zion;<br>
    for it is time to have pity on her.<br>
    Yes, the set time has come.<br>
    14 For your servants take pleasure in her stones,<br>
    and have pity on her dust.<br>
    15 So the nations will fear the Lord’s name,<br>
    all the kings of the earth your glory.<br>
    16 For the Lord has built up Zion.<br>
    He has appeared in his glory.<br>
    17 He has responded to the prayer of the destitute,<br>
    and has not despised their prayer.<br>
    18 This will be written for the generation to come.<br>
    A people which will be created will praise the Lord.<br>
    19 For he has looked down from the height of his sanctuary.<br>
    From heaven, the Lord saw the earth;<br>
    20 to hear the groans of the prisoner;<br>
    to free those who are condemned to death;<br>
    21 that men may declare the Lord’s name in Zion,<br>
    and his praise in Jerusalem;<br>
    22 when the peoples are gathered together,<br>
    the kingdoms, to serve the Lord.<br>
    23 He weakened my strength along the course.<br>
    He shortened my days.<br>
    24 I said, “My God, don’t take me away in the middle of my days.<br>
    Your years are throughout all generations.<br>
    25 Of old, you laid the foundation of the earth.<br>
    The heavens are the work of your hands.<br>
    26 They will perish, but you will endure.<br>
    Yes, all of them will wear out like a garment.<br>
    You will change them like a cloak, and they will be changed.<br>
    27 But you are the same.<br>
    Your years will have no end.<br>
    28 The children of your servants will continue.<br>
    Their offspring will be established before you.”

  <h4>Psalm 103</h4>
  <p>
    1 Praise the Lord, my soul!<br>
    All that is within me, praise his holy name!<br>
    2 Praise the Lord, my soul,<br>
    and don’t forget all his benefits,<br>
    3 who forgives all your sins,<br>
    who heals all your diseases,<br>
    4 who redeems your life from destruction,<br>
    who crowns you with loving kindness and tender mercies,<br>
    5 who satisfies your desire with good things,<br>
    so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.<br>
    6 The Lord executes righteous acts,<br>
    and justice for all who are oppressed.<br>
    7 He made known his ways to Moses,<br>
    his deeds to the children of Israel.<br>
    8 The Lord is merciful and gracious,<br>
    slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness.<br>
    9 He will not always accuse;<br>
    neither will he stay angry forever.<br>
    10 He has not dealt with us according to our sins,<br>
    nor repaid us for our iniquities.<br>
    11 For as the heavens are high above the earth,<br>
    so great is his loving kindness toward those who fear him.<br>
    12 As far as the east is from the west,<br>
    so far has he removed our transgressions from us.<br>
    13 Like a father has compassion on his children,<br>
    so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him.<br>
    14 For he knows how we are made.<br>
    He remembers that we are dust.<br>
    15 As for man, his days are like grass.<br>
    As a flower of the field, so he flourishes.<br>
    16 For the wind passes over it, and it is gone.<br>
    Its place remembers it no more.<br>
    17 But the Lord’s loving kindness is from everlasting to everlasting<br>
    with those who fear him,<br>
    his righteousness to children’s children;<br>
    18 to those who keep his covenant,<br>
    to those who remember to obey his precepts.<br>
    19 The Lord has established his throne in the heavens.<br>
    His kingdom rules over all.<br>
    20 Praise the Lord, you angels of his,<br>
    who are mighty in strength, who fulfill his word,<br>
    obeying the voice of his word.<br>
    21 Praise the Lord, all you armies of his,<br>
    you servants of his, who do his pleasure.<br>
    22 Praise the Lord, all you works of his,<br>
    in all places of his dominion.<br>
    Praise the Lord, my soul!

    16 The man who wanders out of the way of understanding<br>
    shall rest in the assembly of the departed spirits.<br>
    17 He who loves pleasure will be a poor man.<br>
    He who loves wine and oil won’t be rich.<br>
    18 The wicked is a ransom for the righteous,<br>
    the treacherous for the upright.<br>
    19 It is better to dwell in a desert land,<br>
    than with a contentious and fretful woman.<br>
    20 There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise,<br>
    but a foolish man swallows it up.<br>
    21 He who follows after righteousness and kindness<br>
    finds life, righteousness, and honor.<br>
    22 A wise man scales the city of the mighty,<br>
    and brings down the strength of its confidence.<br>
    23 Whoever guards his mouth and his tongue<br>
    keeps his soul from troubles.<br>
    24 The proud and haughty man—“scoffer” is his name—<br>
    he works in the arrogance of pride.<br>
    25 The desire of the sluggard kills him,<br>
    for his hands refuse to labor.<br>
    26 There are those who covet greedily all day long;<br>
    but the righteous give and don’t withhold.<br>
    27 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination—<br>
    how much more, when he brings it with a wicked mind!<br>
    28 A false witness will perish,<br>
    and a man who listens speaks to eternity.<br>
    29 A wicked man hardens his face;<br>
    but as for the upright, he establishes his ways.<br>
    30 There is no wisdom nor understanding<br>
    nor counsel against the Lord.<br>
    31 The horse is prepared for the day of battle;<br>
    but victory is with the Lord.

  <h4>Sirach 37</h4>
  <p>
    1 Every friend says, “I am his friend, too,”<br>
    but there is a friend who is only a friend in name.<br>
    2 Isn’t there a grief in it—even to death—<br>
    when a companion and friend is turned into an enemy?<br>
    3 O wicked imagination, why were you created<br>
    to cover the land with deceit?<br>
    4 A companion delights in the gladness of a friend,<br>
    but in time of affliction he will be against him.<br>
    5 A companion labors with his friend to satisfy his appetite;<br>
    but in time of trouble he will lift up his shield.<br>
    6 Don’t forget a friend in your soul;<br>
    don’t be unmindful of him in your riches.<br>
    7 Every counselor extols counsel;<br>
    but some give counsel for themselves.<br>
    8 Beware of a counselor; know before what is his interest<br>
    (for he will take counsel for himself)<br>
    lest he cast the lot against you<br>
    9 and say to you, “Your way is good,”<br>
    then stand on the other side to see what will happen to you.<br>
    10 Don’t take counsel with one who looks askance at you,<br>
    and hide your intentions from those who are jealous of you.<br>
    11 Don’t take counsel with a woman about her rival,<br>
    with a coward about war,<br>
    with a merchant about exchange,<br>
    with a buyer about selling,<br>
    with an envious man about thankfulness,<br>
    with an unmerciful man about kindness,<br>
    with a sluggard about any kind of work,<br>
    with one who does yearly service about the end of a year,<br>
    with a lazy servant about a big work—<br>
    don’t depend on these for any counsel.<br>
    12 But stay continually with a godly man,<br>
    whom you know to be a keeper of the commandments,<br>
    who is like-minded with yourself,<br>
    and who will sorrow with you if you fail.<br>
    13 And establish the counsel of your own heart;<br>
    for there is no one more faithful to you than it.<br>
    14 For a man’s soul is sometimes inclined to inform him<br>
    better than seven watchmen who sit on high on their watchtower.<br>
    15 Above all this, pray to the Most High<br>
    that he may direct your way in truth.<br>
    16 Let reason be the beginning of every work,<br>
    and let counsel go before every action.<br>
    17 As a token of the changing of the heart,<br>
    four sorts of things appear: good and evil, life and death;<br>
    and the tongue rules over them continually.<br>
    18 A man of understanding instructs many,<br>
    and he himself is useful to his own soul.<br>
    19 He who speaks charmingly is hated.<br>
    In every city, he will be despised for not speaking wisely.<br>
    20 Yet a man is not favored for his fine speech,<br>
    and no sinner is established for his outstanding gifts.<br>
    21 He who does violence to his own house will inherit the wind.<br>
    A fool will be servant to the wise-hearted.<br>
    22 The mouth of the righteous produces wisdom,<br>
    but the perverse tongue will be cut off.<br>
    23 The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable.<br>
    The mouth of the wicked speaks perversity.<br>
    *(Note: Some verses here overlap with Proverbs themes, but align with Sirach’s text context.)*<br>
    24 Sort out your own advice first; after that, speak.<br>
    Let your reasoning stand the test of truth.<br>
    25 God’s blessing is not found where wickedness abides,<br>
    nor does truth dwell in deceitful counsel.<br>
    26 Let God’s wisdom guide your words and footsteps,<br>
    that your ways may be established in righteousness.

    Lord my God, you are very great.<br>
    You are clothed with honor and majesty.<br>
    2 He covers himself with light as with a garment.<br>
    He stretches out the heavens like a curtain.<br>
    3 He lays the beams of his rooms in the waters.<br>
    He makes the clouds his chariot.<br>
    He walks on the wings of the wind.<br>
    4 He makes his messengers winds;<br>
    his servants flames of fire.<br>
    5 He laid the foundations of the earth,<br>
    that it should not be moved forever.<br>
    6 You covered it with the deep as with a cloak.<br>
    The waters stood above the mountains.<br>
    7 At your rebuke they fled.<br>
    At the voice of your thunder they hurried away.<br>
    8 The mountains rose,<br>
    the valleys sank down,<br>
    to the place which you had assigned to them.<br>
    9 You have set a boundary that they may not pass over,<br>
    that they don’t turn again to cover the earth.<br>
    10 He sends out springs into the valleys.<br>
    They run among the mountains.<br>
    11 They give drink to every animal of the field.<br>
    The wild donkeys quench their thirst.<br>
    12 The birds of the sky nest by them.<br>
    They sing among the branches.<br>
    13 He waters the mountains from his rooms.<br>
    The earth is filled with the fruit of your works.<br>
    14 He causes the grass to grow for the livestock,<br>
    and plants for man to cultivate,<br>
    that he may produce food out of the earth:<br>

    The stork makes its home in the cypress trees.<br>
    18 The high mountains are for the wild goats.<br>
    The rocks are a refuge for the rock badgers.<br>
    19 He appointed the moon for seasons.<br>
    The sun knows when to set.<br>
    20 You make darkness, and it is night,<br>
    in which all the animals of the forest prowl.<br>
    21 The young lions roar after their prey,<br>
    and seek their food from God.<br>
    22 The sun rises, and they steal away,<br>
    and lie down in their dens.<br>
    23 Man goes out to his work,<br>
    to his labor until the evening.<br>
    24 Lord, how many are your works!<br>
    In wisdom you have made them all.<br>
    The earth is full of your riches.<br>
    25 There is the sea, great and wide,<br>
    in which are innumerable living things,<br>
    both small and large animals.<br>
    26 There the ships go,<br>
    and leviathan, whom you formed to play there.<br>
    27 These all wait for you,<br>
    that you may give them their food in due season.<br>
    28 You give to them; they gather.<br>
    You open your hand; they are satisfied with good.<br>
    29 You hide your face; they are troubled.<br>
    You take away their breath; they die, and return to the dust.<br>
    30 You send out your Spirit and they are created.<br>
    You renew the face of the ground.<br>
    31 Let the Lord’s glory endure forever.<br>
    Let the Lord rejoice in his works.<br>
    32 He looks at the earth, and it trembles.<br>
    He touches the mountains, and they smoke.<br>
    33 I will sing to the Lord as long as I live.<br>
    I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.<br>
    34 Let my meditation be sweet to him.<br>
    I will rejoice in the Lord.<br>
    35 Let sinners be consumed out of the earth.<br>
    Let the wicked be no more.<br>

  <p>
    1 A good name is more desirable than great riches,<br>
    and loving favor is better than silver and gold.<br>
    2 The rich and the poor have this in common:<br>
    the Lord is the maker of them all.<br>
    3 A prudent man sees danger and hides himself;<br>
    but the simple pass on, and suffer for it.<br>
    4 The result of humility and the fear of the Lord<br>
    is wealth, honor, and life.<br>
    5 Thorns and snares are in the path of the wicked:<br>
    whoever guards his soul stays from them.<br>
    6 Train up a child in the way he should go,<br>
    and when he is old he will not depart from it.<br>
    7 The rich rule over the poor.<br>
    The borrower is servant to the lender.<br>
    8 He who sows wickedness reaps trouble,<br>
    and the rod of his fury will be destroyed.<br>
    9 He who has a generous eye will be blessed,<br>
    for he shares his food with the poor.<br>
    10 Drive out the mocker, and strife will go out;<br>
    yes, quarrels and insults will stop.<br>

    but he frustrates the words of the unfaithful.<br>
    13 The sluggard says, “There is a lion outside!<br>
    I will be killed in the streets!”<br>
    14 The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit.<br>
    He who is under the Lord’s wrath will fall into it.<br>
    15 Folly is bound up in the heart of a child.<br>
    The rod of discipline drives it far from him.<br>
    16 Whoever oppresses the poor for his own increase and whoever gives to the rich,<br>
    both come to poverty.

    1 Honor a physician with the honor due to him<br>
    for the uses which you may have of him;<br>
    for truly the Lord has created him.<br>
    2 For from the Most High comes healing,<br>
    and he will receive a gift from the king.<br>
    3 The skill of the physician lifts up his head.<br>
    In the sight of great men, he will be admired.<br>
    4 The Lord created medicines out of the earth.<br>
    A prudent man will not abhor them.<br>
    5 Wasn’t water made sweet with wood,<br>
    that its virtue might be known?<br>
    6 And he has given men skill,<br>
    that he might be glorified in his marvelous works.<br>
    7 With them, the pharmacist makes a mixture.<br>
    He will not cease from their works.<br>
    8 Peace from him is over all the earth.<br>
    My son, don’t be negligent when you are sick,<br>
    but pray to the Lord, and he will heal you.<br>
    9 Put away wrongdoing. Cleanse your hands.<br>
    Cleanse your heart from all sin.<br>
    10 Offer a sweet offering and a memorial of fine flour.<br>
    Make your offering as rich as you can afford.<br>
    11 Then give place to the physician, for truly the Lord has created him.<br>
    Don’t let him go away from you, for you need him.<br>
    12 There is a time when in their hands is the success of their craft;<br>
    13 for they will also beg the Lord to prosper their diagnosis for the sake of preserving life.<br>
    14 He who sins before his Maker—<br>
    let him fall into the hand of the physician.<br>
    15 My son, let your tears fall over the dead,<br>
    and begin to lament as if you had suffered great harm yourself;<br>
    and then cover his body according to his due,<br>
    and don’t neglect his burial.<br>
    16 Weep bitterly, and make great lamentation,<br>
    and make mourning according to his merit,<br>
    for a day or two, lest you be spoken evil of;<br>
    and so comfort yourself for your sorrow.<br>
    17 For of heaviness comes death,<br>
    and the heaviness of the heart breaks strength.<br>
    18 When you’re taken away, sorrow remains.<br>
    A poor man’s life is better than a fool’s death.<br>
    19 In the clothing of the heart is sorrow;<br>
    and the wickedness of a man weighs down his heart.<br>
    20 Don’t give your heart to sorrow.<br>
    Put it away, remembering your end.<br>
    21 Don’t forget it, for there is no coming again;<br>
    you do him no good, and you hurt yourself.<br>
    22 Remember his judgment, for yours also will be so.<br>
    Yesterday was his, and today yours.<br>
    23 When the dead is at rest, let his remembrance rest;<br>
    be comforted for him, once his spirit has departed.<br>
    24 The wisdom of a scribe comes by opportunity of leisure.<br>
    He who has little business shall become wise.<br>
    25 How can he get wisdom who holds the plow,<br>
    who glories in the shaft of the goad,<br>
    who drives oxen, and is occupied in their labors,<br>
    and whose talk is about bulls?<br>
    26 He sets his heart upon turning his furrows.<br>
    His lack of sleep is to give his heifers fodder.<br>
    27 So is every craftsman and workmaster,<br>
    who labors night and day:<br>
    those who engrave signets, and are diligent to make great variety.<br>
    They set their heart upon the likeness of the image,<br>
    and watch over the work to finish it perfectly.<br>
    28 So does the smith sitting by the anvil,<br>
    considering the unwrought iron.<br>
    The vapor of the fire wastes his flesh.<br>
    He wrestles in the heat of the furnace.<br>
    The noise of the hammer is ever in his ears,<br>
    and his eyes are upon the pattern of the vessel.<br>
    29 So does the potter, sitting at his work,<br>
    turning the wheel around with his feet,<br>
    who is always anxiously set at his work,<br>
    and makes all his output by number.<br>
    30 He fashions the clay with his arm.<br>
    He bends down his strength before his feet.<br>
    He applies his heart to finish the glazing,<br>
    and is careful to clean the furnace.<br>
    31 All these trust in their hands;<br>
    each is wise in his own craft.<br>
    32 Without these, a city can’t be inhabited.<br>
    They will neither live nor walk around there.<br>
    Yet they are not sought out in the council of the people,<br>
    nor do they mount on high in the assembly;<br>
    33 They don’t sit on the seat of the judge,<br>
    nor understand the covenant of judgment.<br>
    They can’t declare instruction and judgment,<br>
    and they are not found using proverbs.<br>
    34 But they maintain the fabric of the world.<br>
    Their desire is in the work of their craft.

  <p>
    1 Give thanks to the Lord! Call on his name!<br>
    Make his doings known among the peoples.<br>
    2 Sing to him, sing praises to him!<br>
    Tell of all his marvelous works.<br>
    3 Glory in his holy name.<br>
    Let the heart of those who seek the Lord rejoice.<br>
    4 Seek the Lord and his strength.<br>
    Seek his face forever more.<br>
    5 Remember his marvelous works that he has done;<br>
    his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,<br>
    6 you offspring of Abraham, his servant,<br>
    you children of Jacob, his chosen ones.<br>
    7 He is the Lord, our God.<br>
    His judgments are in all the earth.<br>
    8 He has remembered his covenant forever,<br>
    the word which he commanded to a thousand generations,<br>
    9 the covenant which he made with Abraham,<br>
    his oath to Isaac,<br>
    10 and confirmed it to Jacob for a statute;<br>
    to Israel for an everlasting covenant,<br>
    11 saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan,<br>
    the lot of your inheritance,”<br>
    12 when they were but a few men in number,<br>
    yes, very few, and foreigners in it.<br>
    13 They went about from nation to nation,<br>
    from one kingdom to another people.<br>
    14 He allowed no one to do them wrong.<br>
    Yes, he reproved kings for their sakes,<br>
    15 “Don’t touch my anointed ones!<br>
    Do my prophets no harm!”<br>
    16 He called for a famine on the land.<br>
    He destroyed the food supplies.<br>
    17 He sent a man before them.<br>
    Joseph was sold for a slave.<br>
    18 They bruised his feet with shackles.<br>
    His neck was locked in irons,<br>
    19 until the time that his word happened,<br>
    and the Lord’s word proved him true.<br>
    20 The king sent and freed him;<br>
    even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free.<br>
    21 He made him lord of his house,<br>
    and ruler of all of his possessions;<br>
    22 to discipline his princes at his pleasure,<br>
    and to teach his elders wisdom.<br>
    23 Israel also came into Egypt.<br>
    Jacob lived in the land of Ham.<br>
    24 He increased his people greatly,<br>
    and made them stronger than their adversaries.<br>
    25 He turned their heart to hate his people,<br>
    to conspire against his servants.<br>
    26 He sent Moses, his servant,<br>
    and Aaron, whom he had chosen.<br>
    27 They performed miracles among them,<br>
    and wonders in the land of Ham.<br>
    28 He sent darkness, and made it dark.<br>
    They didn’t rebel against his words.<br>
    29 He turned their waters into blood,<br>
    and killed their fish.<br>
    30 Their land swarmed with frogs,<br>
    even in the rooms of their kings.<br>
    31 He spoke, and swarms of flies came,<br>
    and lice in all their borders.<br>
    32 He gave them hail for rain,<br>
    with lightning in their land.<br>
    33 He struck their vines and also their fig trees,<br>
    and shattered the trees of their country.<br>
    34 He spoke, and the locusts came<br>
    with the grasshoppers, without number.<br>
    35 They ate up every plant in their land;<br>
    and ate up the fruit of their ground.<br>
    36 He struck also all the firstborn in their land,<br>
    the first fruits of all their manhood.<br>
    37 He brought them out with silver and gold.<br>
    There was not one feeble person among his tribes.<br>
    38 Egypt was glad when they departed,<br>
    for the fear of them had fallen on them.<br>
    39 He spread a cloud for a covering,<br>
    fire to give light in the night.<br>
    40 They asked, and he brought quails,<br>
    and satisfied them with the bread of the sky.<br>
    41 He opened the rock, and waters gushed out.<br>
    They ran as a river in the dry places.<br>
    42 For he remembered his holy word,<br>
    and Abraham, his servant.<br>
    43 He brought his people out with joy,<br>
    his chosen with singing.<br>
    44 He gave them the lands of the nations.<br>
    They took the labor of peoples in possession,<br>
    45 that they might keep his statutes,<br>
    and observe his laws.<br>
    Praise the Lord!

  <h4>Psalm 106</h4>
  <p>
    1 Praise the Lord!<br>
    Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good,<br>
    for his loving kindness endures forever.<br>
    2 Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord,<br>
    or fully declare all his praise?<br>
    3 Blessed are those who keep justice.<br>
    Blessed is one who does what is right at all times.<br>
    4 Remember me, Lord, with the favor that you show to your people.<br>
    Visit me with your salvation,<br>
    5 that I may see the prosperity of your chosen,<br>
    that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation,<br>
    that I may glory with your inheritance.<br>
    6 We have sinned with our fathers.<br>
    We have committed iniquity.<br>
    We have done wickedly.<br>
    7 Our fathers didn’t understand your wonders in Egypt.<br>
    They didn’t remember the multitude of your loving kindnesses,<br>
    but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.<br>
    8 Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake,<br>
    that he might make his mighty power known.<br>
    9 He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up;<br>
    so he led them through the depths, as through a desert.<br>
    10 He saved them from the hand of him who hated them,<br>
    and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.<br>
    11 The waters covered their adversaries.<br>
    There was not one of them left.<br>
    12 Then they believed his words.<br>
    They sang his praise.<br>
    13 They soon forgot his works.<br>
    They didn’t wait for his counsel,<br>
    14 but gave in to craving in the desert,<br>
    and tested God in the wasteland.<br>
    15 He gave them their request,<br>
    but sent leanness into their soul.<br>
    16 They envied Moses also in the camp,<br>
    and Aaron, the Lord’s saint.<br>
    17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,<br>
    and covered the company of Abiram.<br>
    18 A fire was kindled in their company.<br>
    The flame burned up the wicked.<br>
    19 They made a calf in Horeb,<br>
    and worshiped a molten image.<br>
    20 Thus they exchanged their glory<br>
    for an image of a bull that eats grass.<br>
    21 They forgot God, their Savior,<br>
    who had done great things in Egypt,<br>
    22 wondrous works in the land of Ham,<br>
    and awesome things by the Red Sea.<br>
    23 Therefore he said that he would destroy them,<br>
    had Moses, his chosen, not stood before him in the breach,<br>
    to turn away his wrath, so that he wouldn’t destroy them.<br>
    24 Yes, they despised the pleasant land.<br>
    They didn’t believe his word,<br>
    25 but murmured in their tents,<br>
    and didn’t listen to the Lord’s voice.<br>
    26 Therefore he swore to them<br>
    that he would overthrow them in the wilderness,<br>
    27 that he would overthrow their offspring among the nations,<br>
    and scatter them in the lands.<br>
    28 They joined themselves also to Baal Peor,<br>
    and ate the sacrifices of the dead.<br>
    29 Thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds.<br>
    The plague broke in on them.<br>
    30 Then Phinehas stood up and executed judgment,<br>
    so the plague was stopped.<br>
    31 That was credited to him for righteousness<br>
    for all generations to come.<br>
    32 They angered him also at the waters of Meribah,<br>
    so that Moses was troubled for their sakes;<br>
    33 because they were rebellious against his spirit,<br>
    he spoke rashly with his lips.<br>
    34 They didn’t destroy the peoples,<br>
    as the Lord commanded them,<br>
    35 but mixed themselves with the nations,<br>
    and learned their works.<br>
    36 They served their idols,<br>
    which became a snare to them.<br>
    37 Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.<br>
    38 They shed innocent blood,<br>
    even the blood of their sons and of their daughters,<br>
    whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan.<br>
    The land was polluted with blood.<br>
    39 Thus they were defiled with their works,<br>
    and prostituted themselves in their deeds.<br>
    40 Therefore the Lord burned with anger against his people.<br>
    He abhorred his inheritance.<br>
    41 He gave them into the hand of the nations.<br>
    Those who hated them ruled over them.<br>
    42 Their enemies also oppressed them.<br>
    They were brought into subjection under their hand.<br>
    43 He rescued them many times,<br>
    but they were rebellious in their counsel,<br>
    and were brought low in their iniquity.<br>
    44 Nevertheless he regarded their distress,<br>
    when he heard their cry.<br>
    45 He remembered for them his covenant,<br>
    and repented according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.<br>
    46 He made them also to be pitied<br>
    by all those who carried them captive.<br>
    47 Save us, Lord, our God,<br>
    gather us from among the nations,<br>
    to give thanks to your holy name,<br>
    to triumph in your praise!<br>
    48 Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,<br>
    from everlasting even to everlasting!<br>
    Let all the people say, “Amen.”<br>
    Praise the Lord!

    if you are a man given to appetite.<br>
    3 Don’t be desirous of his dainties,<br>

    4 Don’t weary yourself to be rich.<br>
    In your wisdom, show restraint.<br>
    5 Why do you set your eyes on that which is not?<br>
    For it certainly sprouts wings like an eagle and flies in the sky.<br>
    6 Don’t eat the food of him who has a stingy eye,<br>
    and don’t crave his delicacies;<br>
    7 for as he thinks about the cost, so he is.<br>
    “Eat and drink!” he says to you,<br>

    10 Don’t move the ancient boundary stone.<br>
    Don’t encroach on the fields of the fatherless;<br>
    11 for their Defender is strong.<br>
    He will plead their case against you.<br>
    12 Apply your heart to instruction,<br>

    13 Don’t withhold correction from a child.<br>
    If you punish him with the rod, he will not die.<br>
    14 Punish him with the rod,<br>

    15 My son, if your heart is wise,<br>
    then my heart will be glad, even mine.<br>
    16 Yes, my heart will rejoice,<br>
    when your lips speak what is right.<br>
    17 Don’t let your heart envy sinners,<br>
    but rather fear the Lord all day long.<br>

  <h4>Psalm 107</h4>
  <p>
    1 Give thanks to the Lord,<br>
    for he is good,<br>
    for his loving kindness endures forever.<br>
    2 Let the redeemed by the Lord say so,<br>
    whom he has redeemed from the hand of the adversary,<br>
    3 and gathered out of the lands,<br>
    from the east and from the west,<br>
    from the north and from the south.<br>
    4 They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way.<br>
    They found no city to live in.<br>
    5 Hungry and thirsty,<br>
    their soul fainted in them.<br>
    6 Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble,<br>
    and he delivered them out of their distresses.<br>
    7 He led them also by a straight way,<br>
    that they might go to a city to live in.<br>
    8 Let them praise the Lord for his loving kindness,<br>
    for his wonderful deeds for the children of men!<br>
    9 For he satisfies the longing soul.<br>
    He fills the hungry soul with good.<br>
    10 Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death,<br>
    being bound in affliction and iron,<br>
    11 because they rebelled against the words of God,<br>
    and scorned the counsel of the Most High.<br>
    12 Therefore he brought down their heart with labor.<br>
    They fell down, and there was no one to help.<br>
    13 Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble,<br>
    and he saved them out of their distresses.<br>
    14 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,<br>
    and broke away their chains.<br>
    15 Let them praise the Lord for his loving kindness,<br>
    for his wonderful deeds to the children of men!<br>
    16 For he has broken the gates of bronze,<br>
    and cut through bars of iron.<br>
    17 Fools are afflicted because of their disobedience,<br>
    and because of their iniquities.<br>
    18 Their soul abhors all kinds of food.<br>
    They draw near to the gates of death.<br>
    19 Then they cry to the Lord in their trouble,<br>
    he saves them out of their distresses.<br>
    20 He sends his word, and heals them,<br>
    and delivers them from their graves.<br>
    21 Let them praise the Lord for his loving kindness,<br>
    for his wonderful deeds for the children of men!<br>
    22 Let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving,<br>
    and declare his deeds with singing.<br>
    23 Those who go down to the sea in ships,<br>
    who do business in great waters;<br>
    24 these see the Lord’s deeds,<br>
    and his wonders in the deep.<br>
    25 For he commands, and raises the stormy wind,<br>
    which lifts up its waves.<br>
    26 They mount up to the sky; they go down again to the depths.<br>
    Their soul melts away because of trouble.<br>
    27 They reel back and forth, and stagger like a drunken man,<br>
    and are at their wits’ end.<br>
    28 Then they cry to the Lord in their trouble,<br>
    and he brings them out of their distress.<br>
    29 He makes the storm a calm,<br>
    so that its waves are still.<br>
    30 Then they are glad because it is calm,<br>
    so he brings them to their desired haven.<br>
    31 Let them praise the Lord for his loving kindness,<br>
    for his wonderful deeds for the children of men!<br>
    32 Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people,<br>
    and praise him in the seat of the elders.<br>
    33 He turns rivers into a desert,<br>
    water springs into a thirsty ground,<br>
    34 and a fruitful land into a salt waste,<br>
    for the wickedness of those who dwell in it.<br>
    35 He turns a desert into a pool of water,<br>
    and a dry land into water springs.<br>
    36 There he makes the hungry live,<br>
    that they may prepare a city to live in,<br>
    37 sow fields, plant vineyards,<br>
    and reap the fruits of increase.<br>
    38 He blesses them also, so that they are multiplied greatly.<br>
    He doesn’t allow their livestock to decrease.<br>
    39 Again, they are diminished and bowed down<br>
    through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.<br>
    40 He pours contempt on princes,<br>
    and causes them to wander in a trackless waste.<br>
    41 Yet he lifts the needy out of their affliction,<br>
    and increases their families like a flock.<br>
    42 The upright will see it, and be glad.<br>
    All the wicked will shut their mouths.<br>
    43 Whoever is wise will pay attention to these things.<br>
    They will consider the loving kindnesses of the Lord.

    20 Don’t be among ones drinking too much wine,<br>
    or those who gorge themselves on meat;<br>
    21 for the drunkard and the glutton shall become poor,<br>
    and drowsiness clothes them in rags.<br>
    22 Listen to your father who gave you life,<br>
    and don’t despise your mother when she is old.<br>
    23 Buy the truth, and don’t sell it.<br>
    Get wisdom, discipline, and understanding.<br>
    24 The father of the righteous has great joy.<br>
    Whoever fathers a wise child delights in him.<br>
    25 Let your father and your mother be glad!<br>
    Let her who bore you rejoice!<br>
    26 My son, give me your heart,<br>
    and let your eyes keep in my ways.<br>
    27 For a prostitute is a deep pit;<br>
    and a wayward wife is a narrow well.<br>
    28 Yes, she lies in wait like a robber,<br>
    and increases the unfaithful among men.<br>
    29 Who has woe?<br>
    Who has sorrow?<br>
    Who has strife?<br>
    Who has complaints?<br>
    Who has needless bruises?<br>
    Who has bloodshot eyes?<br>
    30 Those who stay long at the wine;<br>
    those who go to seek out mixed wine.<br>
    31 Don’t look at the wine when it is red,<br>
    when it sparkles in the cup,<br>
    when it goes down smoothly.<br>
    32 In the end, it bites like a snake,<br>
    and poisons like a viper.<br>
    33 Your eyes will see strange things,<br>
    and your mind will imagine confusing things.<br>
    34 Yes, you will be as he who lies down in the midst of the sea,<br>
    or as he who lies on top of the rigging:<br>
    35 “They hit me, and I was not hurt!<br>
    They beat me, and I don’t feel it!<br>
    When will I wake up?<br>
    I will do it again.<br>
    I will look for more.”

    1 He who devotes himself to the study of the law of the Most High<br>
    and ponders the wisdom of all the ancients<br>
    will keep his heart to perceive the subtle points;<br>
    2 he will be active among renowned men,<br>
    and appear before rulers.<br>
    He will travel through the lands of foreign nations;<br>
    for he has tested good things among men.<br>
    3 He will direct his heart early to resort to the Lord who made him,<br>
    and will make supplication before the Most High.<br>
    He will open his mouth in prayer,<br>
    and make supplication for his sins.<br>
    4 If the great Lord will,<br>
    he will be filled with the spirit of understanding.<br>
    He will pour forth wise sayings,<br>
    and give thanks to the Lord in prayer.<br>
    5 He will direct his counsel and knowledge,<br>
    and meditate on his secrets.<br>
    6 He will show the instruction which he has been taught,<br>
    and will glory in the law of the Lord’s covenant.<br>
    7 Many will commend his understanding.<br>
    It will never be blotted out.<br>
    His memory will not depart;<br>
    his name will live through all generations.<br>
    8 Nations will declare his wisdom,<br>
    and the congregation will proclaim his praise.<br>
    9 If he continues, he will leave a name greater than a thousand,<br>
    and if he goes to rest, it will be to his advantage.<br>
    10 Yet more, I will utter, saying as I have thought;<br>
    I am filled as the moon at the full.<br>
    11 Listen to me, you holy children,<br>
    and bud like a rose growing by a brook of water.<br>
    12 Give off a sweet fragrance like frankincense.<br>
    Blossom as a lily.<br>
    Send forth a fragrance, and sing a hymn of praise.<br>
    Bless the Lord for all his works.<br>
    13 Magnify his name.<br>
    Proclaim his praise<br>
    with the songs of your lips, and with harps.<br>
    Thus you shall say when you proclaim his praise:<br>
    14 “All the works of the Lord are exceedingly good,<br>
    and every command will be accomplished in its season.<br>
    15 No one can say, ‘What is this?’ or ‘Why is that?’<br>
    For every question will be answered in its time.<br>
    His command will satisfy every need,<br>
    and none can hinder his salvation.<br>
    16 The works of all flesh are before him;<br>
    nothing can be hidden from his eyes.<br>
    17 He sees from everlasting to everlasting;<br>
    there is nothing too marvelous for him.<br>
    18 No one can say, ‘What is this?’ or ‘Why is that?’<br>
    for everything is created for its own use.”

    1 My heart is steadfast, God.<br>
    I will sing and I will make music with my soul.<br>
    2 Wake up, harp and lyre!<br>
    I will wake up the dawn.<br>
    3 I will give thanks to you, Lord, among the nations.<br>
    I will sing praises to you among the peoples.<br>
    4 For your loving kindness is great above the heavens.<br>
    Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.<br>
    5 Be exalted, God, above the heavens,<br>
    and let your glory be over all the earth.<br>
    6 That your beloved may be delivered,<br>

  <h4>Psalm 109</h4>
  <p>
    1 God of my praise, don’t remain silent,<br>
    2 for they have opened the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit against me.<br>
    They have spoken to me with a lying tongue.<br>
    3 They have also surrounded me with words of hatred,<br>
    and have fought against me without a cause.<br>
    4 In return for my love, they are my adversaries;<br>
    but I am in prayer.<br>
    5 They have rewarded me evil for good,<br>
    and hatred for my love.<br>
    6 Set a wicked man over him.<br>
    Let an adversary stand at his right hand.<br>
    7 When he is judged, let him come out guilty.<br>
    Let his prayer be turned into sin.<br>
    8 Let his days be few.<br>
    Let another take his office.<br>
    9 Let his children be fatherless,<br>
    and his wife a widow.<br>
    10 Let his children be wandering beggars.<br>
    Let them be sought from their ruins.<br>
    11 Let the creditor seize all that he has.<br>
    Let strangers plunder the fruit of his labor.<br>
    12 Let there be no one to extend kindness to him,<br>
    neither let there be anyone to have pity on his fatherless children.<br>
    13 Let his posterity be cut off.<br>
    In the generation following let their name be blotted out.<br>
    14 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered by the Lord.<br>
    Don’t let the sin of his mother be blotted out.<br>
    15 Let them be before the Lord continually,<br>
    that he may cut off their memory from the earth;<br>
    16 because he didn’t remember to show kindness,<br>
    but persecuted the poor and needy man,<br>
    the broken in heart, to kill them.<br>
    17 Yes, he loved cursing, and it came to him.<br>
    He didn’t delight in blessing, and it was far from him.<br>
    18 He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment.<br>
    It came into his inward parts like water,<br>
    like oil into his bones.<br>
    19 Let it be to him as the clothing with which he covers himself,<br>
    for the belt that is always around him.<br>
    20 This is the reward of my adversaries from the Lord,<br>
    of those who speak evil against my soul.<br>
    21 But deal with me, the Lord the Lord, for your name’s sake,<br>
    because your loving kindness is good, deliver me;<br>
    22 for I am poor and needy.<br>
    My heart is wounded within me.<br>
    23 I fade away like an evening shadow.<br>
    I am shaken off like a locust.<br>
    24 My knees are weak through fasting.<br>
    My body is thin and lacks fat.<br>
    25 I have also become a reproach to them.<br>
    When they see me, they shake their head.<br>
    26 Help me, Lord, my God.<br>
    Save me according to your loving kindness;<br>
    27 that they may know that this is your hand,<br>
    that you, Lord, have done it.<br>
    28 They may curse, but you bless.<br>
    When they arise, they will be shamed,<br>
    but your servant shall rejoice.<br>
    29 Let my adversaries be clothed with dishonor.<br>
    Let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe.<br>
    30 I will give great thanks to the Lord with my mouth.<br>
    Yes, I will praise him among the multitude.<br>
    31 For he will stand at the right hand of the needy,<br>
    to save him from those who judge his soul.

  <p>
    1 Don’t be envious of evil men,<br>
    neither desire to be with them;<br>
    2 for their hearts plot violence,<br>
    and their lips talk about mischief.<br>
    3 Through wisdom a house is built;<br>
    by understanding it is established;<br>
    4 by knowledge the rooms are filled<br>
    with all rare and beautiful treasure.<br>
    5 A wise man has great power;<br>
    and a knowledgeable man increases strength;<br>
    6 for by wise guidance you wage your war;<br>
    and victory is in many advisors.<br>
    7 Wisdom is too high for a fool.<br>
    He doesn’t open his mouth in the gate.<br>
    8 One who plots to do evil<br>
    will be called a schemer.<br>
    9 The schemes of folly are sin.<br>
    The mocker is detested by men.<br>
    10 If you falter in the time of trouble,<br>
    your strength is small.<br>
    11 Rescue those who are being led away to death!<br>
    Indeed, hold back those who are staggering to the slaughter!<br>
    12 If you say, “Behold, we didn’t know this,”<br>
    doesn’t he who weighs the hearts consider it?<br>
    He who keeps your soul, doesn’t he know it?<br>
    Shall he not render to every man according to his work?<br>
    13 My son, eat honey, for it is good,<br>
    the droppings of the honeycomb, which are sweet to your taste;<br>
    14 so you shall know wisdom to be to your soul.<br>
    If you have found it, then there will be a reward;<br>
    your hope will not be cut off.<br>
    15 Don’t lay in wait, wicked man, against the habitation of the righteous.<br>
    Don’t destroy his resting place;<br>

    so to the sinners they will be turned into evil.<br>
    32 There are winds created for vengeance;<br>
    in their fury they lay on strong blows.<br>
    In the time of destruction they pour out their force,<br>

    33 Fire, hail, famine, and death—<br>
    all these were created for vengeance.<br>
    34 Teeth of wild animals, scorpions, vipers,<br>

    35 They will rejoice in his command;<br>
    they will be ready upon earth when need is;<br>

    Don’t let your heart be glad when he is overthrown,<br>
    18 lest the Lord see it, and it displease him,<br>
    and he turn away his wrath from him.<br>
    19 Don’t fret yourself because of evildoers,<br>
    neither be envious of the wicked;<br>
    20 for there will be no reward to the evil man.<br>
    The lamp of the wicked will be snuffed out.<br>
    21 My son, fear the Lord and the king.<br>
    Don’t join those who are rebellious;<br>
    22 for their calamity will rise suddenly.<br>
    Who knows what destruction may come from them both?<br>
    23 These also are sayings of the wise.<br>
    To show partiality in judgment is not good.<br>
    24 He who says to the wicked, “You are righteous,”<br>

    I will repay the man according to his work.”<br>
    30 I went by the field of the sluggard,<br>
    by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;<br>
    31 behold, it was all grown over with thorns.<br>
    Its surface was covered with nettles,<br>
    and its stone wall was broken down.<br>
    32 Then I saw, and considered well.<br>
    I saw, and received instruction:<br>
    33 a little sleep, a little slumber,<br>

    from the day of their coming out of their mother’s womb,<br>
    until the day of their return to the mother of all things—<br>
    2 their imagination of things to come, and the day of death.<br>
    3 From him who sits on a throne of glory to him who is humbled in earth and ashes;<br>
    4 from him who wears purple and a crown, to him who is clothed with a rough linen frock—<br>
    5 there is wrath, envy, trouble, unrest, and fear of death,<br>
    and anger forever abides.<br>
    6 In the time of rest upon his bed,<br>
    the sleep of the night changes his knowledge.<br>
    7 A little or nothing is his rest,<br>
    and afterward in his sleep, as in a day of keeping watch,<br>
    he is disturbed by the vision of his heart,<br>
    as one who escaped from the front of battle.<br>
    8 In the day of his safety, he wakes up, trembling,<br>
    perceiving the vanity of his fear.<br>
    9 With all flesh, man, beast, and sinner—<br>
    sevenfold more for sinners.<br>
    10 Death, bloodshed, strife, sword,<br>
    calamities, famine, tribulation, and the scourge—<br>
    these things are created for the wicked,<br>
    and for their sakes destruction came.<br>
    11 All that is of the earth returns to the earth.<br>
    That which is of the waters returns to the sea.<br>
    12 All bribery and injustice will be blotted out,<br>
    but true dealing will stand forever.<br>
    13 The goods of the unjust will be dried up like a river,<br>
    and will vanish with noise like great thunder in rain.<br>
    14 While he opens his hands, he will rejoice;<br>
    so transgressors will come to nothing.<br>

    18 Life is sweet to a diligent laboring man,<br>

    20 Wine and music rejoice the heart,<br>

    21 The flute and the lute make sweet melody,<br>
    but a pleasant tongue is better than both.<br>
    22 Your eye desires grace and beauty,<br>
    but green plants more than both.<br>
    23 A friend and a companion meet occasionally,<br>
    but it is better than both to have a wife and a husband,<br>
    along with each other.<br>
    24 Brothers and help are for a time of trouble;<br>
    but almsgiving rescues better than both.<br>
    25 Gold and silver will make the foot stand sure,<br>
    but well-ordered counsel is esteemed more than both.<br>
    26 Wealth and strength lift up the heart,<br>
    but the fear of the Lord is better than both.<br>
    There is no lack with the fear of the Lord,<br>
    and with it there is no need to seek for help.<br>

    it covers a man more than any glory.<br>
    28 My son, don’t lead a beggar’s life.<br>
    Better it is to die than to beg.<br>
    29 A man who looks to the table of another person,<br>
    his life is not considered as a life.<br>
    He will pollute his soul with another man’s food;<br>
    but a wise man and well-instructed will beware of that.<br>
    30 Begging is sweet in the mouth of the shameless,<br>
    but in his belly a fire shall be kindled.

  <!-- Psalms 114, 115, 116 -->
  <h3>Psalms</h3>

  <h4>Psalm 114</h4>
  <p>
    1 When Israel went out of Egypt,<br>
    the house of Jacob from a people of foreign language;<br>
    2 Judah became his sanctuary,<br>
    Israel his dominion.<br>
    3 The sea saw it, and fled.<br>
    The Jordan was driven back.<br>
    4 The mountains skipped like rams,<br>
    the little hills like lambs.<br>
    5 What was it, you sea, that you fled?<br>
    You Jordan, that you turned back?<br>
    6 You mountains, that you skipped like rams?<br>
    You little hills, like lambs?<br>
    7 Tremble, earth, at the presence of the Lord,<br>
    at the presence of the God of Jacob,<br>
    8 who turned the rock into a pool of water,<br>
    the flint into a spring of waters.
  </p>

  <h4>Psalm 115</h4>
  <p>
    1 Not to us, Lord, not to us,<br>
    but to your name give glory,<br>
    for your loving kindness, and for your truth’s sake.<br>
    2 Why should the nations say,<br>
    “Where is their God, now?”<br>
    3 But our God is in the heavens.<br>
    He does whatever he pleases.<br>
    4 Their idols are silver and gold,<br>
    the work of men’s hands.<br>
    5 They have mouths, but they don’t speak.<br>
    They have eyes, but they don’t see.<br>
    6 They have ears, but they don’t hear.<br>
    They have noses, but they don’t smell.<br>
    7 They have hands, but they don’t feel.<br>
    They have feet, but they don’t walk,<br>
    neither do they speak through their throat.<br>
    8 Those who make them will be like them;<br>
    yes, everyone who trusts in them.<br>
    9 Israel, trust in the Lord!<br>
    He is their help and their shield.<br>
    10 House of Aaron, trust in the Lord!<br>
    He is their help and their shield.<br>
    11 You who fear the Lord, trust in the Lord!<br>
    He is their help and their shield.<br>
    12 The Lord remembers us. He will bless us.<br>
    He will bless the house of Israel.<br>
    He will bless the house of Aaron.<br>
    13 He will bless those who fear the Lord,<br>
    both small and great.<br>
    14 May the Lord increase you more and more—<br>
    you and your children.<br>
    15 Blessed are you by the Lord,<br>
    who made heaven and earth.<br>
    16 The heavens are the heavens of the Lord;<br>
    but the earth he has given to the children of men.<br>
    17 The dead don’t praise the Lord,<br>
    neither any who go down into silence;<br>
    18 but we will bless the Lord,<br>
    from this time forward and forever more.<br>
    Praise the Lord!
  </p>

  <h4>Psalm 116</h4>
  <p>
    1 I love the Lord, because he listens to my voice,<br>
    and my cries for mercy.<br>
    2 Because he has turned his ear to me,<br>
    therefore I will call on him as long as I live.<br>
    3 The cords of death surrounded me,<br>
    the pains of Sheol got a hold of me.<br>
    I found trouble and sorrow.<br>
    4 Then I called on the Lord’s name:<br>
    “Lord, I beg you, deliver my soul.”<br>
    5 The Lord is gracious and righteous.<br>
    Yes, our God is merciful.<br>
    6 The Lord preserves the simple.<br>
    I was brought low, and he saved me.<br>
    7 Return to your rest, my soul,<br>
    for the Lord has dealt bountifully with you.<br>
    8 For you have delivered my soul from death,<br>
    my eyes from tears,<br>
    and my feet from falling.<br>
    9 I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living.<br>
    10 I believed, therefore I said,<br>
    “I was greatly afflicted.”<br>
    11 I said in my haste,<br>
    “All people are liars.”<br>
    12 What will I give to the Lord for all his benefits toward me?<br>
    13 I will take the cup of salvation, and call on the Lord’s name.<br>
    14 I will pay my vows to the Lord,<br>
    yes, in the presence of all his people.<br>
    15 Precious in the Lord’s sight is the death of his saints.<br>
    16 Lord, truly I am your servant.<br>
    I am your servant, the son of your servant girl.<br>
    You have freed me from my chains.<br>
    17 I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving,<br>
    and will call on the Lord’s name.<br>
    18 I will pay my vows to the Lord,<br>
    yes, in the presence of all his people,<br>
    19 in the courts of the Lord’s house,<br>
    in the middle of you, Jerusalem.<br>
    Praise the Lord!

  <!-- Proverbs 25:1–14 -->
  <h3>Proverbs</h3>
  <h4>Proverbs 25:1–14</h4>
  <p>
    1 These also are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.<br>
    2 It is the glory of God to conceal a thing,<br>
    but the glory of kings is to search out a matter.<br>
    3 As the heavens for height, and the earth for depth,<br>
    so the hearts of kings are unsearchable.<br>
    4 Take away the dross from the silver,<br>
    and material comes out for the refiner;<br>
    5 take away the wicked from the king’s presence,<br>
    and his throne will be established in righteousness.<br>
    6 Don’t exalt yourself in the presence of the king,<br>
    or claim a place among great men;<br>
    7 for it is better that it be said to you, “Come up here,”<br>
    than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince,<br>
    whom your eyes have seen.<br>
    8 Don’t be hasty in bringing charges to court.<br>
    What will you do in the end when your neighbor shames you?<br>
    9 Debate your case with your neighbor,<br>
    and don’t betray the confidence of another;<br>
    10 lest one who hears it put you to shame,<br>
    and your bad reputation never depart.<br>
    11 A word fitly spoken<br>
    is like apples of gold in settings of silver.<br>
    12 As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold,<br>
    so is a wise reprover to an obedient ear.<br>
    13 As the cold of snow in the time of harvest,<br>
    so is a faithful messenger to those who send him;<br>
    for he refreshes the soul of his masters.<br>
    14 As clouds and wind without rain,<br>
    so is he who boasts of gifts deceptively.

  <!-- Sirach 39:19–35 is already covered in Day 45, so continuing with Sirach 40 was Day 46, Sirach 41 is Day 47, etc. Let's proceed accordingly. -->
  <!-- But per the reading plan, Day 47 calls for Sirach 41. -->

  <h3>Sirach</h3>
  <h4>Sirach 41</h4>
  <p>
    1 O death, how bitter is the remembrance of you<br>
    to a man who is at peace in his possessions,<br>
    to the man who has nothing to distract him,<br>
    and has prosperity in all things,<br>
    and still is strong to take food!<br>
    2 O death, how acceptable is your sentence to a man who is needy,<br>
    and who fails in strength,<br>
    who is in extreme old age,<br>
    and is distracted about everything;<br>
    to one who waits, and distrusts,<br>
    and has lost patience!<br>
    3 Don’t fear the sentence of death.<br>
    Remember those who have been before you and that come after;<br>
    this is the sentence from the Lord over all flesh.<br>
    4 And why do you refuse the good pleasure of the Most High?<br>
    Whether life is ten or a hundred or a thousand years,<br>
    there is no inquisition about life in Sheol.<br>
    5 The children of sinners are abominable children,<br>
    and they frequent the dwellings of the ungodly.<br>
    6 The inheritance of sinners’ children will perish,<br>
    and their posterity will have a perpetual reproach.<br>
    7 Children will complain of an ungodly father,<br>
    because they will be reproached for his sake.<br>
    8 Woe to you, ungodly men,<br>
    who have forsaken the law of the Most High God!<br>
    9 If you are born, you will be born to a curse;<br>
    if you die, a curse will be your portion.<br>
    10 All things that are of the earth return to the earth;<br>
    so the ungodly go from a curse to destruction.<br>
    11 The mourning of men is about their bodies;<br>
    but an evil name of sinners will be blotted out.<br>
    12 Have regard to your name;<br>
    for it remains with you longer than a thousand great treasures of gold.<br>
    13 A good life has its number of days;<br>
    but a good name endures forever.<br>
    14 My children, keep discipline in peace;<br>
    for wisdom that is hidden and a treasure that is not seen—<br>
    what profit is in them both?<br>
    15 A man who hides his foolishness is better than a man who hides his wisdom.<br>
    16 Therefore be ashamed according to my word;<br>
    for it is not good to keep every kind of shame,<br>
    and not all things are approved by all in truth.<br>
    17 Be ashamed of prostitution before father and mother;<br>
    of a lie before a prince or a mighty man;<br>
    18 of an offense before a judge or ruler;<br>
    of iniquity before the congregation and the people;<br>
    of injustice before a companion and friend;<br>
    19 and of theft in the place where you live.<br>
    Be ashamed of the truth of God and his covenant;<br>
    of leaning with your elbow at dinner;<br>
    of scurrilous speech before friends.<br>
    After you have chosen wise discipline, be ashamed.<br>
    Thus you will be truly modest,<br>
    and find favor in the sight of every man.

  <h3>Psalms</h3>

  <h4>Psalm 117</h4>
  <p>
    1 Praise the Lord, all you nations!<br>
    Extol him, all you peoples!<br>
    2 For his loving kindness is great toward us.<br>
    The Lord’s faithfulness endures forever.<br>
    Praise the Lord!
  </p>

  <h4>Psalm 118</h4>
  <p>
    1 Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good,<br>
    for his loving kindness endures forever.<br>
    2 Let Israel now say<br>
    that his loving kindness endures forever.<br>
    3 Let the house of Aaron now say<br>
    that his loving kindness endures forever.<br>
    4 Now let those who fear the Lord say<br>
    that his loving kindness endures forever.<br>
    5 Out of my distress, I called on the Lord.<br>
    The Lord answered me with freedom.<br>
    6 The Lord is on my side. I will not be afraid.<br>
    What can man do to me?<br>
    7 The Lord is on my side among those who help me.<br>
    Therefore I will look in triumph at those who hate me.<br>
    8 It is better to take refuge in the Lord<br>
    than to put confidence in man.<br>
    9 It is better to take refuge in the Lord<br>
    than to put confidence in princes.<br>
    10 All the nations surrounded me,<br>
    but in the Lord’s name I cut them off.<br>
    11 They surrounded me, yes, they surrounded me.<br>
    In the Lord’s name I indeed cut them off.<br>
    12 They surrounded me like bees.<br>
    They are quenched like the burning thorns.<br>
    In the Lord’s name I cut them off.<br>
    13 You pushed me back hard, to make me fall,<br>
    but the Lord helped me.<br>
    14 The Lord is my strength and song.<br>
    He has become my salvation.<br>
    15 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of the righteous.<br>
    “The right hand of the Lord does valiantly.<br>
    16 The right hand of the Lord is exalted!<br>
    The right hand of the Lord does valiantly!”<br>
    17 I will not die, but live,<br>
    and declare the Lord’s works.<br>
    18 The Lord has punished me severely,<br>
    but he has not given me over to death.<br>
    19 Open to me the gates of righteousness.<br>
    I will enter into them. I will give thanks to the Lord.<br>
    20 This is the gate of the Lord.<br>
    The righteous will enter into it.<br>
    21 I will give thanks to you, for you have answered me,<br>
    and have become my salvation.<br>
    22 The stone which the builders rejected<br>
    has become the cornerstone.<br>
    23 This is the Lord’s doing.<br>
    It is marvelous in our eyes.<br>
    24 This is the day that the Lord has made.<br>
    We will rejoice and be glad in it!<br>
    25 Save us now, we beg you, Lord!<br>
    Lord, we beg you, send prosperity now.<br>
    26 Blessed is he who comes in the Lord’s name!<br>
    We have blessed you out of the Lord’s house.<br>
    27 The Lord is God, and he has given us light.<br>
    Bind the sacrifice with cords, even to the horns of the altar.<br>
    28 You are my God, and I will give thanks to you.<br>
    You are my God, I will exalt you.<br>
    29 Oh give thanks to the Lord, for he is good,<br>
    for his loving kindness endures forever.

  <h3>Proverbs</h3>
  <h4>Proverbs 25:15–28</h4>
  <p>
    15 By patience a ruler is persuaded.<br>
    A soft tongue breaks the bone.<br>
    16 Have you found honey?<br>
    Eat as much as is sufficient for you,<br>
    lest you eat too much, and vomit it.<br>
    17 Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor’s house,<br>
    lest he be weary of you, and hate you.<br>
    18 A man who gives false testimony against his neighbor<br>
    is like a club, a sword, or a sharp arrow.<br>
    19 Confidence in someone unfaithful in time of trouble<br>
    is like a bad tooth or a lame foot.<br>
    20 As one who takes away a garment in cold weather,<br>
    or vinegar on soda,<br>
    so is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.<br>
    21 If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat.<br>
    If he is thirsty, give him water to drink,<br>
    22 for you will heap coals of fire on his head,<br>
    and the Lord will reward you.<br>
    23 The north wind produces rain;<br>
    so a backbiting tongue brings an angry face.<br>
    24 It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop,<br>
    than to share a house with a contentious woman.<br>
    25 Like cold water to a thirsty soul,<br>
    so is good news from a far country.<br>
    26 Like a muddied spring and a polluted well,<br>
    so is a righteous man who gives way before the wicked.<br>
    27 It is not good to eat much honey,<br>
    nor is it honorable to seek one’s own honor.<br>
    28 Like a city that is broken down and without walls<br>
    is a man whose spirit is without restraint.

  <p>
    1 Of these things don’t be ashamed:<br>
    and don’t sin to save face:<br>
    2 of the law of the Most High and his covenant,<br>
    of judgment to do justice,<br>
    of reckoning with a partner and traveling companions,<br>
    of a gift from the inheritance of friends;<br>
    3 of exactness of balance and weights,<br>
    of getting much or little;<br>
    4 of bargaining in dealing with a merchant,<br>
    of frequent correction of children,<br>
    and of making the sides of a wicked servant to bleed.<br>
    5 Where there is an evil wife, a seal is good;<br>
    and where there are many hands, lock things up.<br>
    6 Whatever you deliver out, do it by number and weight;<br>
    put all in writing that you give out or take in.<br>
    7 Don’t be ashamed to instruct the unwise and foolish,<br>
    and the extremely aged who contends with those young in years;<br>
    so you will be truly instructed,<br>
    and approved in the sight of every man.<br>
    8 A daughter is a secret cause of wakefulness to a father;<br>
    the care for her takes away sleep;<br>
    in her youth, lest she pass the flower of her age;<br>
    and when she is married, lest she be hated;<br>
    9 in her virginity, lest she be defiled,<br>
    or get with child in her father’s house;<br>
    and having a husband, lest she transgress;<br>
    or, being married, lest she be barren.<br>
    10 Keep a strict watch over a headstrong daughter,<br>
    lest she find liberty for herself, and use it.<br>
    11 Beware of all women who prostitute themselves,<br>
    lest you make your own children fall into destruction,<br>
    and your family line suffer.<br>
    12 Don’t gaze at every pretty woman,<br>
    and don’t sit in the midst of women.<br>
    13 For from garments comes the moth,<br>
    and from a woman a woman’s wickedness.<br>
    14 Better is the wickedness of a man than a woman who does good,<br>
    and it is a woman who brings shame and reproach.<br>
    15 I will now remember the works of the Lord,<br>
    and declare the things that I have seen.<br>
    The Lord’s works are in his words.<br>
    16 The sun that gives light looks on all things;<br>
    the Lord’s work is full of his glory.<br>
    17 The Lord has not given power to the saints to declare all his marvelous works,<br>
    which the Almighty Lord firmly settled,<br>
    that the universe might stand firm in his glory.<br>
    18 He searches out the deep, the heart,<br>
    and he has understanding of their cunning devices;<br>
    for the Most High knows all knowledge,<br>
    and sees into the signs of the world,<br>
    19 declaring the things that are past and the things that are to come,<br>
    and revealing the traces of hidden things.<br>
    20 No thought escapes him.<br>
    Not one word is hidden from him.<br>
    21 He has ordered the mighty works of his wisdom.<br>
    He is from everlasting to everlasting.<br>
    Nothing has been added,<br>
    nor diminished,<br>
    and he has no need of any counselor.<br>
    22 How desirable are all his works!<br>
    One may see this even to a spark.<br>
    23 All these things live and remain forever in all uses,<br>
    and they are all obedient.<br>
    24 All things are in pairs, one opposite the other;<br>
    he has made nothing imperfect.<br>
    25 One thing establishes the good things of another;<br>
    who could ever see enough of his glory?

    4 You have commanded your precepts,<br>

    for I have sought your precepts.<br>
    46 I will also speak of your statutes before kings,<br>
    and will not be disappointed.<br>
    47 I will delight myself in your commandments,<br>
    because I love them.<br>
    48 I reach out my hands for your commandments, which I love.<br>
    I will meditate on your statutes.

  <p>
    1 Like snow in summer, and as rain in harvest,<br>
    so honor is not fitting for a fool.<br>
    2 Like a fluttering sparrow,<br>
    like a darting swallow,<br>
    so the undeserved curse doesn’t come to rest.<br>
    3 A whip is for the horse,<br>
    a bridle for the donkey,<br>
    and a rod for the back of fools!<br>
    4 Don’t answer a fool according to his folly,<br>
    lest you also be like him.<br>
    5 Answer a fool according to his folly,<br>
    lest he be wise in his own eyes.<br>
    6 One who sends a message by the hand of a fool<br>
    is cutting off feet and drinking violence.<br>
    7 Like the legs of the lame that hang loose:<br>
    so is a parable in the mouth of fools.<br>
    8 As one who binds a stone in a sling,<br>
    so is he who gives honor to a fool.<br>
    9 Like a thorn bush that goes into the hand of a drunkard,<br>
    so is a parable in the mouth of fools.<br>
    10 As an archer who wounds all,<br>
    so is he who hires a fool<br>
    or he who hires those who pass by.<br>
    11 As a dog that returns to his vomit,<br>
    so is a fool who repeats his folly.<br>
    12 Do you see a man wise in his own eyes?<br>
    There is more hope for a fool than for him.<br>
    13 The sluggard says, “There is a lion in the road!<br>
    A fierce lion roams the streets!”<br>
    14 As the door turns on its hinges,<br>
    so does the sluggard on his bed.<br>
    15 The sluggard buries his hand in the dish.<br>
    He is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth.

    1 The pride of the heights is the clear sky,<br>
    the beauty of heaven is in the vision of glory.<br>
    2 The sun when it appears, bringing tidings as it goes forth,<br>
    is a marvelous instrument, the work of the Most High.<br>
    3 At noon it dries up the land,<br>
    and who can stand against its burning heat?<br>
    4 A man blowing a furnace works in the heat,<br>
    but the sun three times more, burning up the mountains.<br>
    It breathes out fiery vapors,<br>
    and with its bright beams it blinds the eyes.<br>
    5 Great is the Lord who made it.<br>
    At his command it runs its course.<br>
    6 He made the moon also to serve in its season,<br>
    to mark the times and to be an everlasting sign.<br>
    7 From the moon is the sign of the feast day;<br>
    a light that wanes when it is finished.<br>
    8 The month is called after its name,<br>
    increasing marvelously in its phases,<br>
    an instrument of the armies on high,<br>
    shining in the vault of heaven.<br>
    9 The beauty of heaven is the glory of the stars,<br>
    an ornament giving light in the highest places of the Lord.<br>
    10 At the command of the Holy One they will stand in their order,<br>
    and will never faint in their watches.<br>
    11 Look upon the rainbow, and praise him who made it.<br>
    It is exceedingly beautiful in its brightness.<br>
    12 It encircles the sky with its glorious circle.<br>
    The hands of the Most High have stretched it.<br>
    13 By his command he makes the snow fall,<br>
    and speeds the lightning of his judgment.<br>
    14 Therefore the storehouses are opened,<br>
    and clouds fly out like birds.<br>
    15 By his great power he makes the clouds firm,<br>
    and the hailstones are broken.<br>
    16 At his sight the mountains are shaken,<br>
    and at his will the south wind blows.<br>
    17 The voice of his thunder rebukes the earth.<br>
    So does the storm from the north, and the whirlwind of the south.<br>
    18 He scatters the snow like birds flying down.<br>
    Its descent is like the coming down of locusts.<br>
    19 The eye marvels at the beauty of its whiteness,<br>
    and the heart is astonished at its raining down.<br>
    20 He also pours the hoarfrost on the earth like salt.<br>
    When it is frozen, it becomes pointed thorns.<br>
    21 The cold north wind blows,<br>
    and the water congeals into ice.<br>
    It settles on every pool of water,<br>
    and the water puts it on like a breastplate.<br>
    22 It devours the mountains,<br>
    and burns up the wilderness,<br>
    and consumes the grass like fire.<br>
    23 A swift remedy for all is the pouring out of dew.<br>
    A refreshing after the heat by the weather changes.<br>
    24 By his counsel he has stilled the deep<br>
    and planted islands in it.<br>
    25 Those who sail on the sea tell of its danger,<br>
    and when we hear it with our ears, we marvel.<br>
    26 There are also those strange and wondrous works,<br>
    varieties of all living things and the monstrous creatures of the sea.<br>
    27 Because of him his messenger prospers,<br>
    and by his word all things hold together.<br>
    28 We may say many things, but we can’t say enough.<br>
    The sum of our words is, “He is the all.”<br>
    29 How shall we have the strength to glorify him?<br>
    For he is himself the great above all his works.<br>
    30 The Lord is awesome and exceedingly great,<br>
    and his power is marvelous.<br>
    31 Glorify the Lord, and exalt him as much as you can.<br>
    For even yet you will fail;<br>
    and when you exalt him, summon all your strength, and don’t be weary;<br>
    for you will never comprehend.<br>
    32 Who has seen him, that he may describe him?<br>
    Who can magnify him as he is?<br>
    33 Many things are hidden greater than these;<br>
    for we have seen but a few of his works.<br>
    34 For the Lord made all things,<br>
    and to the godly he gives wisdom.

    49 Remember your word to your servant,<br>
    because you gave me hope.<br>
    50 This is my comfort in my affliction,<br>
    for your word has revived me.<br>
    51 The arrogant mock me excessively,<br>
    but I don’t turn away from your law.<br>
    52 I remember your ordinances of old, Lord,<br>
    and have comforted myself.<br>
    53 Indignation has taken hold on me,<br>
    because of the wicked who forsake your law.<br>
    54 Your statutes have been my songs<br>
    in the house where I live.<br>
    55 I have remembered your name, Lord, in the night,<br>
    and I obey your law.<br>
    56 This is my way,<br>
    that I keep your precepts.<br>
    <br>
    57 The Lord is my portion.<br>
    I promised to obey your words.<br>
    58 I sought your favor with my whole heart.<br>
    Be merciful to me according to your word.<br>
    59 I considered my ways,<br>
    and turned my steps to your statutes.<br>
    60 I will hurry, and not delay,<br>
    to obey your commandments.<br>
    61 The ropes of the wicked bind me,<br>
    but I won’t forget your law.<br>
    62 At midnight I will rise to give thanks to you,<br>
    because of your righteous ordinances.<br>
    63 I am a friend of all those who fear you,<br>
    of those who observe your precepts.<br>
    64 The earth is full of your loving kindness, Lord.<br>
    Teach me your statutes.<br>
    <br>
    65 Do good to your servant,<br>
    according to your word, Lord.<br>
    66 Teach me good judgment and knowledge,<br>
    for I believe in your commandments.<br>
    67 Before I was afflicted, I went astray;<br>
    but now I observe your word.<br>
    68 You are good, and do good.<br>
    Teach me your statutes.<br>
    69 The proud have smeared a lie upon me.<br>
    With my whole heart, I will keep your precepts.<br>
    70 Their heart is as callous as the fat,<br>
    but I delight in your law.<br>
    71 It is good for me that I have been afflicted,<br>
    that I may learn your statutes.<br>
    72 The law of your mouth is better to me than thousands of pieces of gold and silver.<br>
    <br>
    73 Your hands have made me and formed me.<br>
    Give me understanding, that I may learn your commandments.<br>
    74 Those who fear you will see me and be glad,<br>
    because I have put my hope in your word.<br>
    75 Lord, I know that your judgments are righteous,<br>
    that in faithfulness you have afflicted me.<br>
    76 Please let your loving kindness be for my comfort,<br>
    according to your word to your servant.<br>
    77 Let your tender mercies come to me, that I may live;<br>

    They will know your statutes.<br>
    80 Let my heart be blameless toward your decrees,<br>
    that I may not be disappointed.<br>
    <br>
    81 My soul faints for your salvation.<br>
    I hope in your word.<br>
    82 My eyes fail for your word.<br>
    I say, “When will you comfort me?”<br>
    83 For I have become like a wineskin in the smoke.<br>
    I don’t forget your statutes.<br>
    84 How many are the days of your servant?<br>
    When will you execute judgment on those who persecute me?<br>
    85 The proud have dug pits for me,<br>
    contrary to your law.<br>
    86 All of your commandments are faithful.<br>
    They persecute me wrongfully.<br>
    Help me!<br>
    87 They had almost wiped me from the earth,<br>
    but I didn’t forsake your precepts.<br>

    89 Lord, your word is settled in heaven forever.<br>
    90 Your faithfulness is to all generations.<br>
    You have established the earth, and it remains.<br>
    91 Your laws remain to this day,<br>
    for all things serve you.<br>
    92 Unless your law had been my delight,<br>
    I would have perished in my affliction.<br>
    93 I will never forget your precepts,<br>
    for with them, you have revived me.<br>
    94 I am yours. Save me;<br>
    for I have sought your precepts.<br>
    95 The wicked have waited for me, to destroy me.<br>
    I will consider your statutes.<br>
    96 I have seen a limit to all perfection,<br>
    but your commandments are boundless.<br>
    <br>
    97 How I love your law!<br>
    It is my meditation all day.<br>
    98 Your commandments make me wiser than my enemies,<br>
    for your commandments are always with me.<br>
    99 I have more understanding than all my teachers,<br>
    for your testimonies are my meditation.<br>
    100 I understand more than the aged,<br>
    because I have kept your precepts.<br>
    101 I have kept my feet from every evil way,<br>
    that I might observe your word.<br>
    102 I have not turned away from your ordinances,<br>
    for you have taught me.<br>
    103 How sweet are your promises to my taste,<br>
    more than honey to my mouth!<br>
    104 Through your precepts, I get understanding;<br>
    therefore I hate every false way.<br>
    <br>
    105 Your word is a lamp to my feet,<br>
    and a light for my path.<br>
    106 I have sworn, and have confirmed it,<br>
    that I will obey your righteous ordinances.<br>
    107 I am afflicted very much.<br>
    Revive me, Lord, according to your word.<br>
    108 Accept, I beg you, the willing offerings of my mouth.<br>
    Lord, teach me your ordinances.<br>
    109 My soul is continually in my hand,<br>
    yet I won’t forget your law.<br>
    110 The wicked have laid a snare for me,<br>
    yet I haven’t gone astray from your precepts.<br>
    111 I have taken your testimonies as a heritage forever,<br>
    for they are the joy of my heart.<br>
    112 I have set my heart to perform your statutes forever,<br>
    even to the end.<br>
    <br>
    113 I hate double-minded men,<br>
    but I love your law.<br>
    114 You are my hiding place and my shield.<br>
    I hope in your word.<br>
    115 Depart from me, you evildoers,<br>
    that I may keep the commandments of my God.<br>
    116 Uphold me according to your word, that I may live.<br>
    Let me not be ashamed of my hope.<br>
    117 Hold me up, and I will be safe,<br>
    and will have respect for your statutes continually.<br>
    118 You reject all those who stray from your statutes,<br>
    for their deceit is in vain.<br>
    119 You put away all the wicked of the earth like dross.<br>
    Therefore I love your testimonies.<br>
    120 My flesh trembles for fear of you.<br>
    I am afraid of your judgments.<br>
    <br>
    121 I have done what is just and righteous.<br>
    Don’t leave me to my oppressors.<br>
    122 Ensure your servant’s well-being.<br>
    Don’t let the proud oppress me.<br>
    123 My eyes fail looking for your salvation,<br>
    for your righteous word.<br>
    124 Deal with your servant according to your loving kindness.<br>
    Teach me your statutes.<br>
    125 I am your servant. Give me understanding,<br>
    that I may know your testimonies.<br>
    126 It is time to act, Lord,<br>
    for they break your law.<br>
    127 Therefore I love your commandments more than gold,<br>
    yes, more than pure gold.<br>
    128 Therefore I consider all of your precepts to be right.<br>
    I hate every false way.<br>
    <br>
    129 Your testimonies are wonderful,<br>
    therefore my soul keeps them.<br>
    130 The entrance of your words gives light.<br>
    It gives understanding to the simple.<br>
    131 I opened my mouth wide and panted,<br>
    for I longed for your commandments.<br>
    132 Turn to me, and have mercy on me,<br>
    as you always do to those who love your name.<br>
    133 Establish my footsteps in your word.<br>
    Don’t let any iniquity have dominion over me.<br>
    134 Redeem me from the oppression of man,<br>
    so I will observe your precepts.<br>
    135 Make your face shine on your servant.<br>
    Teach me your statutes.<br>

    16 restraining her is like restraining the wind,<br>
    or like grasping oil in his right hand.<br>
    17 Iron sharpens iron;<br>
    so a man sharpens his friend’s countenance.<br>
    18 Whoever tends the fig tree shall eat its fruit.<br>
    He who looks after his master shall be honored.<br>
    19 Like water reflects a face,<br>
    so a man’s heart reflects the man.<br>
    20 Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied;<br>
    and a man’s eyes are never satisfied.<br>
    21 The crucible is for silver, and the furnace for gold;<br>
    but man is refined by his praise.<br>
    22 Though you grind a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with grain,<br>
    yet his foolishness will not be removed from him.<br>
    23 Know well the state of your flocks,<br>
    and pay attention to your herds;<br>
    24 for riches are not forever,<br>
    nor does even the crown endure to all generations.<br>
    25 The hay is removed, and the new growth appears.<br>
    The grasses of the hills are gathered in.<br>
    26 The lambs are for your clothing,<br>
    and the goats are the price of a field.<br>
    27 There will be plenty of goats’ milk for your food,<br>
    for your family’s food,<br>
    and for the nourishment of your servant girls.

  <h3>Psalms</h3>

  <h4>Psalm 120</h4>
  <p>
    1 In my distress, I cried to the Lord.<br>
    He answered me.<br>
    2 Deliver my soul, Lord, from lying lips,<br>
    from a deceitful tongue.<br>
    3 What will be given to you, and what will be done more to you,<br>
    you deceitful tongue?<br>
    4 Sharp arrows of the mighty,<br>
    with coals of juniper.<br>
    5 Woe is me, that I live in Meshech,<br>
    that I dwell among the tents of Kedar!<br>
    6 My soul has had her dwelling too long<br>
    with him who hates peace.<br>
    7 I am for peace,<br>
    but when I speak, they are for war.
  </p>

  <h4>Psalm 121</h4>
  <p>
    1 I will lift up my eyes to the hills.<br>
    Where does my help come from?<br>
    2 My help comes from the Lord,<br>
    who made heaven and earth.<br>
    3 He will not allow your foot to be moved.<br>
    He who keeps you will not slumber.<br>
    4 Behold, he who keeps Israel<br>
    will neither slumber nor sleep.<br>
    5 The Lord is your keeper.<br>
    The Lord is your shade on your right hand.<br>
    6 The sun will not harm you by day,<br>
    nor the moon by night.<br>
    7 The Lord will keep you from all evil.<br>
    He will keep your soul.<br>
    8 The Lord will keep your going out and your coming in,<br>
    from this time forward, and forever more.

  <h4>Psalm 122</h4>
  <p>
    1 I was glad when they said to me,<br>
    “Let’s go to the Lord’s house!”<br>
    2 Our feet are standing within your gates, Jerusalem,<br>
    3 Jerusalem, that is built as a city that is compact together,<br>
    4 where the tribes go up, even the Lord’s tribes,<br>
    according to an ordinance for Israel,<br>
    to give thanks to the Lord’s name.<br>
    5 For there are set thrones for judgment,<br>
    the thrones of David’s house.<br>
    6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem.<br>
    Those who love you will prosper.<br>
    7 Peace be within your walls,<br>
    and prosperity within your palaces.<br>
    8 For my brothers’ and companions’ sakes,<br>
    I will now say, “Peace be within you.”<br>
    9 For the sake of the house of the Lord our God,<br>
    I will seek your good.
  </p>

  <h4>Psalm 123</h4>
  <p>
    1 I lift up my eyes to you,<br>
    you who sit in the heavens.<br>
    2 Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master,<br>
    as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress,<br>
    so our eyes look to the Lord our God,<br>
    until he has mercy on us.<br>
    3 Have mercy on us, Lord, have mercy on us,<br>
    for we have endured much contempt.<br>
    4 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scoffing of those who are at ease,<br>
    with the contempt of the proud.
  </p>

  <h4>Psalm 124</h4>
  <p>
    1 If it had not been the Lord who was on our side,<br>
    let Israel now say,<br>
    2 if it had not been the Lord who was on our side,<br>
    when men rose up against us;<br>
    3 then they would have swallowed us up alive,<br>
    when their wrath was kindled against us;<br>
    4 then the waters would have overwhelmed us,<br>
    the stream would have gone over our soul;<br>
    5 then the proud waters would have gone over our soul.<br>
    6 Blessed be the Lord,<br>
    who has not given us as a prey to their teeth.<br>
    7 Our soul has escaped like a bird out of the fowler’s snare.<br>
    The snare is broken, and we have escaped.<br>
    8 Our help is in the Lord’s name,<br>
    who made heaven and earth.

  <h3>Proverbs</h3>
  <h4>Proverbs 28:1–14</h4>
  <p>
    1 The wicked flee when no one pursues;<br>
    but the righteous are as bold as a lion.<br>
    2 In rebellion, a land has many rulers,<br>
    but order is maintained by a man of understanding and knowledge.<br>
    3 A needy man who oppresses the poor<br>
    is like a driving rain which leaves no crops.<br>
    4 Those who forsake the law praise the wicked;<br>
    but those who keep the law contend with them.<br>
    5 Evil men don’t understand justice;<br>
    but those who seek the Lord understand it fully.<br>
    6 Better is the poor who walks in his integrity<br>
    than he who is perverse in his ways, and he is rich.<br>
    7 Whoever keeps the law is a wise son,<br>
    but he who is a companion of gluttons shames his father.<br>
    8 He who increases his wealth by excessive interest<br>
    gathers it for one who has pity on the poor.<br>
    9 He who turns away his ear from hearing the law,<br>
    even his prayer is an abomination.<br>
    10 Whoever causes the upright to go astray in an evil way,<br>
    he will fall into his own trap;<br>
    but the blameless will inherit good.<br>
    11 The rich man is wise in his own eyes;<br>
    but the poor who has understanding sees through him.<br>
    12 When the righteous triumph, there is great glory;<br>
    but when the wicked rise, men hide themselves.<br>
    13 He who conceals his sins doesn’t prosper,<br>
    but whoever confesses and renounces them finds mercy.<br>
    14 Blessed is the man who always fears;<br>
    but one who hardens his heart falls into trouble.

    1 Let us now praise famous men,<br>
    and our fathers who became the parents of us.<br>
    2 The Lord has done great glory by them through his great power<br>
    from the beginning.<br>
    3 They ruled in their kingdoms,<br>
    men renowned for their power,<br>
    giving counsel by their understanding,<br>
    and proclaiming prophecies;<br>
    4 leaders of the people by their counsels,<br>
    and by their understanding, learning fit for the people;<br>
    wise words in their writings;<br>
    5 men of skill in music,<br>
    and setting verses in writing;<br>
    6 rich men furnished with resources,<br>
    living peaceably in their habitations—<br>
    7 all these were honored in their generations,<br>
    and were a glory in their days.<br>
    8 Some of them have left a name behind them,<br>
    that their praises might be reported.<br>
    9 Some there are who have no memorial,<br>
    who have perished as though they had not lived;<br>
    and become as though they had not been born,<br>
    and their children after them.<br>
    10 But these were men of mercy,<br>
    whose righteous deeds have not been forgotten.<br>
    11 Their offspring will continue forever.<br>
    Their glory will not be blotted out.<br>
    12 Their bodies were buried in peace,<br>
    and their name lives to all generations.<br>
    13 Peoples will declare their wisdom,<br>
    and the congregation tells out their praise.<br>
    14 Enoch pleased the Lord, and was translated,<br>
    being an example of repentance to all generations.<br>
    15 Noah was found perfect and righteous.<br>
    In the time of wrath, he was taken in exchange for the world;<br>
    therefore a remnant was left to the earth when the flood came.<br>
    16 Everlasting covenants were made with him,<br>
    that all flesh should no more be blotted out by a flood.<br>
    17 Abraham was a great father of many nations.<br>
    His glory was more than that of any other ancestor.<br>
    18 In the covenant with him, his flesh was put to the test.<br>
    When he was tested, he was found faithful.<br>
    19 Therefore God assured him by an oath<br>
    that he would bless the nations in his offspring;<br>
    that he would multiply him like the dust of the earth,<br>
    exalt his offspring like the stars,<br>
    and cause them to inherit from sea to sea,<br>
    and from the River to the utmost parts of the land.<br>
    20 In Isaac, he established likewise, for Abraham his father’s sake,<br>
    a blessing for all men and the covenant.<br>
    21 He made it rest upon the head of Jacob.<br>
    He acknowledged him in his blessings,<br>
    gave him an inheritance,<br>
    and divided his portions among twelve tribes.

  <h3>Psalms</h3>

  <h4>Psalm 125</h4>
  <p>
    1 Those who trust in the Lord are as Mount Zion,<br>
    which can’t be moved, but remains forever.<br>
    2 As the mountains surround Jerusalem,<br>
    so the Lord surrounds his people from this time forward and forever more.<br>
    3 For the scepter of wickedness won’t remain over the allotment of the righteous,<br>
    so that the righteous won’t use their hands to do evil.<br>
    4 Do good, Lord, to those who are good,<br>
    to those who are upright in their hearts.<br>
    5 But as for those who turn away to their crooked ways,<br>
    the Lord will lead them away with the workers of iniquity.<br>
    Peace be on Israel.
  </p>

  <h4>Psalm 126</h4>
  <p>
    1 When the Lord brought back those who returned to Zion,<br>
    we were like those who dream.<br>
    2 Then our mouth was filled with laughter,<br>
    and our tongue with singing.<br>
    Then they said among the nations,<br>
    “The Lord has done great things for them.”<br>
    3 The Lord has done great things for us,<br>
    and we are glad.<br>
    4 Restore our fortunes again, Lord,<br>
    like the streams in the Negev.<br>
    5 Those who sow in tears will reap in joy.<br>
    6 He who goes out weeping, carrying seed for sowing,<br>
    will certainly come again with joy, carrying his sheaves.
  </p>

  <h4>Psalm 127</h4>
  <p>
    1 Unless the Lord builds the house,<br>
    they labor in vain who build it.<br>
    Unless the Lord watches over the city,<br>
    the watchman guards it in vain.<br>
    2 It is vain for you to rise up early, to stay up late,<br>
    eating the bread of toil;<br>
    for he gives sleep to his loved ones.<br>
    3 Behold, children are a heritage of the Lord.<br>
    The fruit of the womb is his reward.<br>
    4 As arrows in the hand of a mighty man,<br>
    so are the children of youth.<br>
    5 Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them.<br>
    They won’t be disappointed when they speak with their enemies in the gate.
  </p>

  <h4>Psalm 128</h4>
  <p>
    1 Blessed is everyone who fears the Lord,<br>
    who walks in his ways.<br>
    2 For you will eat the labor of your hands.<br>
    You will be happy, and it will be well with you.<br>
    3 Your wife will be as a fruitful vine<br>
    in the innermost parts of your house;<br>
    your children like olive shoots around your table.<br>
    4 Behold, thus is the man blessed who fears the Lord.<br>
    5 May the Lord bless you out of Zion,<br>
    and may you see the good of Jerusalem all the days of your life.<br>
    6 Yes, may you see your children’s children.<br>
    Peace be upon Israel.
  </p>

  <h4>Psalm 129</h4>
  <p>
    1 Many times they have afflicted me from my youth up.<br>
    Let Israel now say,<br>
    2 many times they have afflicted me from my youth up,<br>
    yet they have not prevailed against me.<br>
    3 The plowers plowed on my back.<br>
    They made their furrows long.<br>
    4 The Lord is righteous.<br>
    He has cut apart the cords of the wicked.<br>
    5 Let them be disappointed and turned backward,<br>
    all those who hate Zion.<br>
    6 Let them be as the grass on the housetops,<br>
    which withers before it grows up;<br>
    7 with which the reaper doesn’t fill his hand,<br>
    nor he who binds sheaves, his bosom.<br>
    8 Neither do those who go by say,<br>
    “The blessing of the Lord be on you.<br>
    We bless you in the Lord’s name.”
  </p>

  <h4>Psalm 130</h4>
  <p>
    1 Out of the depths I have cried to you, Lord.<br>
    2 Lord, hear my voice.<br>
    Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my petitions.<br>
    3 If you, Lord, kept a record of sins,<br>
    Lord, who could stand?<br>
    4 But there is forgiveness with you,<br>
    therefore you are feared.<br>
    5 I wait for the Lord. My soul waits.<br>
    I hope in his word.<br>
    6 My soul longs for the Lord more than watchmen long for the morning,<br>
    more than watchmen for the morning.<br>
    7 Israel, hope in the Lord,<br>
    for there is loving kindness with the Lord.<br>
    Abundant redemption is with him.<br>
    8 He will redeem Israel from all their sins.
  </p>

  <h4>Psalm 131</h4>
  <p>
    1 Lord, my heart isn’t arrogant, nor my eyes lofty;<br>
    nor do I concern myself with great matters,<br>
    or things too wonderful for me.<br>
    2 Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul,<br>
    like a weaned child with his mother,<br>
    like a weaned child is my soul within me.<br>
    3 Israel, hope in the Lord,<br>
    from this time forward and forever more.

    16 A tyrannical ruler lacks judgment.<br>
    One who hates ill-gotten gain will have long days.<br>
    17 A man who is tormented by life-blood will be a fugitive until death;<br>

    19 One who works his land will have an abundance of food;<br>

    20 A faithful man is rich with blessings;<br>
    but one who is eager to be rich will not go unpunished.<br>
    21 To show partiality is not good;<br>

    1 He brought out of him a merciful man,<br>
    who found favor in the sight of all flesh,<br>
    a man loved by God and men, Moses, whose memory is blessed.<br>
    2 He made him equal to the saints in glory,<br>
    and magnified him in the fears of his enemies.<br>
    3 By his words, he caused signs to cease;<br>
    the Lord glorified him in the presence of kings.<br>
    He gave him commandments for his people,<br>
    and showed him part of his glory.<br>
    4 He sanctified him in his faithfulness and meekness.<br>
    He chose him out of all men.<br>
    5 He made him hear his voice,<br>
    and led him into the thick darkness,<br>
    and gave him commandments face to face,<br>
    even the law of life and knowledge,<br>
    that he might teach Jacob the covenant,<br>
    and Israel his judgments.<br>
    6 He exalted Aaron, a holy man like Moses,<br>
    a brother of him, of the tribe of Levi.<br>
    7 He established an everlasting covenant with him,<br>
    and gave him the priesthood of the people.<br>
    He blessed him with majestic ornaments,<br>
    and girded him with splendid attire:<br>
    8 breeches, and a long robe, and the ephod.<br>
    He encompassed him with pomegranates,<br>
    and with many golden bells all around,<br>
    to send out a sound as he went,<br>
    to make a sound in the temple for a memorial to the children of his people;<br>
    9 with a holy garment, with gold and blue silk,<br>
    and purple, the work of the embroider;<br>
    with an oracle of judgment, even the Urim and Thummim;<br>
    10 with twisted scarlet, the work of a craftsman;<br>
    with precious stones engraved like a signet,<br>
    in a setting of gold, the work of the jeweler,<br>
    for a memorial in engraved letters, according to the number of the tribes of Israel;<br>
    11 with a crown of gold upon the mitre,<br>
    having engraved on it, as on a signet, “Holiness,”<br>
    an ornament of honor, the work of an expert,<br>
    the desires of the eyes, goodly and beautiful.<br>
    12 Before him, such beautiful things hadn’t existed.<br>
    No outsider ever put them on,<br>
    but only his children and his descendants perpetually.<br>
    13 His sacrifices were wholly consumed twice every day continually.<br>
    14 Moses consecrated him,<br>
    and anointed him with holy oil.<br>
    It was an everlasting covenant for him and for his descendants all the days of heaven,<br>
    to minister to the Lord, and to serve as priest, and to bless his people in his name.<br>
    15 He chose him out of all living to offer sacrifices to the Lord,<br>
    incense, and a pleasant fragrance, for a memorial,<br>
    to make reconciliation for his people.<br>
    16 He gave to him his commandments,<br>
    and authority in the statutes of judgments,<br>
    that he might teach Jacob the testimonies,<br>
    and inform Israel in his law.<br>
    17 Strangers conspired together against him,<br>
    and envied him in the wilderness:<br>
    Dathan and Abiram with their company,<br>
    and the congregation of Korah, in wrath and anger.<br>
    18 The Lord saw it, and it displeased him.<br>
    They were consumed in his fierce wrath.<br>
    19 He did wonders against them,<br>
    to consume them with flaming fire.<br>
    20 He added glory to Aaron,<br>
    and gave him a heritage.<br>
    He allotted to him the first fruits of the first labor,<br>
    especially prepared bread in abundance.<br>
    21 For they eat the sacrifices of the Lord,<br>
    which he gave to him and to his descendants.<br>
    22 However, he has no inheritance in the land of the people,<br>
    and he has no portion among the people;<br>
    for the Lord himself is his portion and inheritance.<br>
    23 Phinehas the son of Eleazar is the third in glory,<br>
    in that he was zealous in the fear of the Lord,<br>
    and stood fast in the good forwardness of his soul when the people turned away,<br>
    and he made reconciliation for Israel.<br>
    24 Therefore also a covenant of peace was established with him,<br>
    that he should be leader of the sanctuary and of his people,<br>
    that he and his descendants should have the dignity of the priesthood forever.<br>
    25 Also he made a covenant with David the son of Jesse, of the tribe of Judah.<br>
    The inheritance of the king is his alone from son to son;<br>
    so the inheritance of Aaron is also to his descendants.<br>
    26 May he give you wisdom in your heart to judge his people in righteousness,<br>
    that their good things not be abolished,<br>
    and that their glory may endure forever.

  <h4>Psalm 132</h4>
  <p>
    1 Lord, remember David and all his affliction,<br>
    2 how he swore to the Lord,<br>
    and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:<br>
    3 “Surely I will not come into the structure of my house,<br>
    nor go up into my bed;<br>
    4 I will not give sleep to my eyes,<br>
    or slumber to my eyelids;<br>
    5 until I find a place for the Lord,<br>
    a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.”<br>
    6 Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah.<br>
    We found it in the field of Jaar:<br>
    7 “We will go into his dwelling place.<br>
    We will worship at his footstool.<br>
    8 Arise, Lord, into your resting place;<br>
    you, and the ark of your strength.<br>
    9 Let your priests be clothed with righteousness.<br>
    Let your saints shout for joy!”<br>
    10 For your servant David’s sake,<br>
    don’t turn away the face of your anointed one.<br>
    11 The Lord has sworn to David in truth.<br>
    He will not turn from it:<br>
    “I will set the fruit of your body on your throne.<br>
    12 If your children will keep my covenant,<br>
    my testimony that I will teach them,<br>
    their children also will sit on your throne forever more.”<br>
    13 For the Lord has chosen Zion.<br>
    He has desired it for his habitation.<br>
    14 “This is my resting place forever.<br>
    Here I will live, for I have desired it.<br>
    15 I will abundantly bless her provision.<br>
    I will satisfy her poor with bread.<br>
    16 I will also clothe her priests with salvation.<br>
    Her saints will shout aloud for joy.<br>
    17 I will make the horn of David to bud.<br>
    I have ordained a lamp for my anointed.<br>

    in the courts of our God’s house.<br>
    3 Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good.<br>
    Sing praises to his name, for that is pleasant.<br>
    4 For the Lord has chosen Jacob for himself,<br>
    Israel for his own possession.<br>
    5 For I know that the Lord is great,<br>
    that our Lord is above all gods.<br>
    6 Whatever the Lord pleased, that he has done,<br>
    in heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps;<br>
    7 who causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth;<br>
    who makes lightning with the rain;<br>
    who brings the wind out of his treasuries;<br>
    8 who struck the firstborn of Egypt,<br>
    both of man and animal;<br>
    9 who sent signs and wonders into the middle of you, Egypt,<br>
    on Pharaoh, and on all his servants;<br>
    10 who struck many nations,<br>
    and killed mighty kings—<br>
    11 Sihon king of the Amorites, Og king of Bashan,<br>
    and all the kingdoms of Canaan—<br>
    12 and gave their land for a heritage,<br>
    a heritage to Israel, his people.<br>
    13 Your name, Lord, endures forever;<br>
    your renown, Lord, throughout all generations.<br>
    14 For the Lord will judge his people,<br>
    and have compassion on his servants.<br>
    15 The idols of the nations are silver and gold,<br>
    the work of men’s hands.<br>
    16 They have mouths, but they can’t speak.<br>
    They have eyes, but they can’t see.<br>
    17 They have ears, but they can’t hear.<br>
    Neither is there any breath in their mouths.<br>
    18 Those who make them will be like them;<br>
    yes, everyone who trusts in them.<br>
    19 House of Israel, praise the Lord!<br>
    House of Aaron, praise the Lord!<br>
    20 House of Levi, praise the Lord!<br>
    You who fear the Lord, praise the Lord!<br>
    21 Blessed be the Lord from Zion,<br>
    who dwells at Jerusalem.<br>
    Praise the Lord!

    spreads a net for his feet.<br>
    6 An evil man is snared by his sin,<br>
    but the righteous can sing and be glad.<br>
    7 The righteous care about justice for the poor.<br>
    The wicked aren’t concerned about knowledge.<br>
    8 Mockers stir up a city,<br>
    but wise men turn away anger.<br>

  <p>
    1 Joshua the son of Nun was mighty in war,<br>
    and was the successor of Moses in prophecies.<br>
    He became, according to his name, great for the saving of God’s elect,<br>
    to take vengeance on the enemies that rose up against them,<br>
    that he might give Israel their inheritance.<br>
    2 How was he glorified in the lifting up his hands,<br>
    and in stretching out his sword against the cities!<br>
    3 Who before him ever stood so firm?<br>
    For the Lord himself brought his enemies to him.<br>
    4 Didn’t the sun go back by his hand?<br>
    Didn’t one day become as two?<br>
    5 He called upon the Most High, the Mighty One,<br>
    when his foes pressed him on every side;<br>
    and the great Lord heard him.<br>
    6 With hailstones of mighty power<br>
    he made war break violently on that nation,<br>
    and in the going down he destroyed those who resisted,<br>
    that the nations might know his power,<br>
    because it is not easy to wage war against the Lord;<br>
    and he followed the Mighty One wholly.<br>
    7 Also in the time of Moses, he did a work of mercy—<br>
    he and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,<br>
    in that they withstood the adversary,<br>
    hindered the people from sin,<br>
    and stilled their wicked murmuring.<br>
    8 And of six hundred thousand people on foot,<br>
    they two alone were preserved to bring them into the heritage,<br>
    into a land flowing with milk and honey.<br>
    9 The Lord gave strength also to Caleb,<br>
    and it remained with him to his old age;<br>
    so that he entered upon the high places of the land,<br>
    and his offspring obtained it for a heritage;<br>
    10 that all the children of Israel might see that it is good to walk in the ways of the Lord.<br>
    11 Also the judges, every one by his name,<br>
    all whose hearts didn’t fall into idolatry,<br>
    nor turn away from the Lord—<br>
    may their memory be blessed!<br>
    12 May their bones flourish again out of their place,<br>
    and their name renew in their children!<br>
    13 Samuel, the prophet of the Lord, beloved by his Lord,<br>
    established a kingdom, and anointed princes over his people.<br>
    14 By the law of the Lord, he judged the congregation;<br>
    and the Lord watched over Jacob.<br>
    15 By his faithfulness, he was proved to be a prophet,<br>
    and by his words he was known to be faithful in vision.<br>
    16 He called upon the Mighty Lord,<br>
    when enemies pressed on every side,<br>
    when he offered the sucking lamb.<br>
    17 Then the Lord thundered from heaven,<br>
    and made his voice heard with a mighty sound.<br>
    18 He utterly destroyed the rulers of the Tyrians,<br>
    and all the princes of the Philistines.<br>
    19 Before the time of his eternal sleep,<br>
    Samuel called men to witness before the Lord and his anointed:<br>
    “I have not taken any man’s property,<br>
    not so much as a pair of shoes,”<br>
    and no man accused him.<br>
    20 Even after he had fallen asleep, he prophesied,<br>
    and showed the king his end,<br>
    and lifted up his voice from the earth in prophecy,<br>
    to blot out the wickedness of the people.

    1 By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down.<br>
    Yes, we wept, when we remembered Zion.<br>
    2 On the willows in that land,<br>
    we hung up our harps.<br>
    3 For there, those who led us captive asked us for songs.<br>
    Those who tormented us demanded songs of joy:<br>
    “Sing us one of the songs of Zion!”<br>
    4 How can we sing the Lord’s song in a foreign land?<br>
    5 If I forget you, Jerusalem,<br>
    let my right hand forget its skill.<br>
    6 Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth if I don’t remember you,<br>
    if I don’t prefer Jerusalem above my chief joy.<br>
    7 Remember, Lord, against the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem,<br>
    who said, “Raze it! Raze it even to its foundation!”<br>
    8 Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction,<br>
    he will be happy who repays you,<br>
    as you have done to us.<br>
    9 Happy shall he be,<br>
    who takes and dashes your little ones against the rock.

    and give thanks to your name for your loving kindness and for your truth;<br>
    for you have exalted your name and your word above all.<br>
    3 In the day that I called, you answered me.<br>
    You encouraged me with strength in my soul.<br>
    4 All the kings of the earth will give you thanks, Lord,<br>
    for they have heard the words of your mouth.<br>
    5 Yes, they will sing of the ways of the Lord,<br>
    for the Lord’s glory is great!<br>
    6 For though the Lord is high, yet he looks after the lowly;<br>
    but the proud, he knows from afar.<br>
    7 Though I walk in the middle of trouble, you will revive me.<br>
    You will stretch out your hand against the wrath of my enemies.<br>
    Your right hand will save me.<br>
    8 The Lord will fulfill that which concerns me.<br>
    Your loving kindness, Lord, endures forever.<br>

    but the righteous will see their downfall.<br>
    17 Correct your son, and he will give you peace;<br>
    yes, he will bring delight to your soul.<br>
    18 Where there is no revelation, the people cast off restraint;<br>
    but one who keeps the law is blessed.<br>
    19 A servant can’t be corrected by words.<br>
    Though he understands, yet he will not respond.<br>
    20 Do you see a man who is hasty in his words?<br>
    There is more hope for a fool than for him.<br>
    21 He who pampers his servant from youth<br>

    22 An angry man stirs up strife,<br>

    1 After him rose up Nathan<br>
    to prophesy in the time of David.<br>
    2 As is the fat taken away from the peace offering,<br>
    so was David chosen out of the children of Israel.<br>
    3 He played with lions as with kids,<br>
    and with bears as with lambs of the flock.<br>
    4 In his youth, he killed a giant,<br>
    and took away reproach from the people,<br>
    when he lifted up his hand with a stone in a sling,<br>
    and beat down the boasting of Goliath.<br>
    5 For he called on the Most High Lord,<br>
    and he gave him strength in his right hand<br>
    to kill a mighty warrior,<br>
    and to exalt the power of his people.<br>
    6 So they glorified him for his tens of thousands,<br>
    and praised him for the blessings of the Lord,<br>
    in that a glorious crown was placed on his head.<br>
    7 For he destroyed the enemies on every side,<br>
    and brought to nothing the Philistines, his adversaries.<br>
    He broke their power to this day.<br>
    8 In all his works, he gave thanks to the Holy One,<br>
    the Most High, with words of glory.<br>
    He sang praise with his whole heart,<br>
    and loved him who made him.<br>
    9 He set singers also before the altar,<br>
    to make sweet melody by their voices.<br>
    10 He gave beauty to the feasts,<br>
    and set in order the seasons to perfection,<br>
    while they praised his holy name,<br>
    and the sanctuary resounded from early morning.<br>
    11 The Lord took away his sins,<br>
    and exalted his horn forever.<br>
    He gave him a covenant of kings,<br>
    and a throne of glory in Israel.<br>
    12 After him rose up a wise son,<br>
    who lived in security because of him.<br>
    13 Solomon reigned in days of peace,<br>
    and God gave him rest all around,<br>
    that he might set up a house for his name,<br>
    and prepare a sanctuary forever.<br>
    14 How wise you were in your youth,<br>
    and filled as a river with instruction!<br>
    15 Your soul covered the earth,<br>
    and you filled it with parables and riddles.<br>
    16 Your name reached to the far islands,<br>
    and you were beloved for your peace.<br>
    17 Countries marveled at you for your songs, proverbs, parables, and riddles.<br>
    18 You were called by the glorious name,<br>
    which was called upon Israel,<br>
    and you gathered gold like tin,<br>
    and multiplied silver like lead.<br>
    19 But you laid your loins next to women,<br>
    and you were brought into subjection in your body.<br>
    20 You stained your honor,<br>
    and profaned your seed,<br>
    so that you brought wrath upon your children,<br>
    and they were grieved at your folly.<br>
    21 So the kingdom was divided,<br>
    and out of Ephraim came a disobedient kingdom.<br>
    22 But the Lord will never forsake his mercy,<br>
    and he will not destroy any of his works,<br>
    nor blot out the offspring of his elect;<br>
    and he will not take away the seed of him who loves him.<br>
    So he gave a remnant to Jacob,<br>
    and to David a root out of him.<br>
    23 Thus Solomon rested with his fathers,<br>
    and left behind him one of his offspring,<br>
    the foolishness of the people,<br>
    and one who lacked understanding, Rehoboam,<br>
    who made the people revolt.<br>
    Also Jeroboam the son of Nebat,<br>
    who caused Israel to sin,<br>
    and gave a way of sin to Ephraim.<br>
    24 Their sins were multiplied exceedingly,<br>
    to remove them from their land.<br>
    25 For they sought out every kind of wickedness,<br>
    until vengeance came upon them.

    1 Lord, you have searched me,<br>
    and you know me.<br>
    2 You know my sitting down and my rising up.<br>
    You perceive my thoughts from afar.<br>
    3 You search out my path and my lying down,<br>
    and are acquainted with all my ways.<br>
    4 For there is not a word on my tongue,<br>
    but behold, Lord, you know it altogether.<br>
    5 You hem me in behind and before.<br>
    You laid your hand on me.<br>
    6 This knowledge is beyond me.<br>
    It’s lofty. I can’t attain it.<br>
    7 Where could I go from your Spirit?<br>
    Or where could I flee from your presence?<br>
    8 If I ascend up into heaven, you are there.<br>
    If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, you are there!<br>
    9 If I take the wings of the dawn,<br>
    and settle in the uttermost parts of the sea,<br>
    10 even there your hand will lead me,<br>
    and your right hand will hold me.<br>
    11 If I say, “Surely the darkness will overwhelm me.<br>
    The light around me will be night,”<br>
    12 even the darkness doesn’t hide from you,<br>
    but the night shines as the day.<br>
    The darkness is like light to you.<br>
    13 For you formed my inmost being.<br>
    You knit me together in my mother’s womb.<br>
    14 I will give thanks to you,<br>
    for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.<br>
    Your works are wonderful.<br>
    My soul knows that very well.<br>
    15 My frame wasn’t hidden from you,<br>
    when I was made in secret,<br>
    woven together in the depths of the earth.<br>
    16 Your eyes saw my body.<br>
    In your book they were all written,<br>
    the days that were ordained for me,<br>
    when as yet there were none of them.<br>
    17 How precious to me are your thoughts, God!<br>
    How vast is their sum!<br>
    18 If I would count them, they are more in number than the sand.<br>
    When I wake up, I am still with you.<br>
    19 If only you, God, would kill the wicked.<br>
    Get away from me, you bloodthirsty men!<br>
    20 For they speak against you wickedly.<br>
    Your enemies take your name in vain.<br>
    21 Lord, don’t I hate those who hate you?<br>
    Am I not grieved with those who rise up against you?<br>
    22 I hate them with perfect hatred.<br>
    They have become my enemies.<br>
    23 Search me, God, and know my heart.<br>

    16 Sheol, the barren womb,<br>

    1 Then the prophet Elijah arose like a fire.<br>
    His word burned like a torch.<br>
    2 He brought a famine on them.<br>
    By his zeal, he made them few in number.<br>
    3 By the word of the Lord, he shut up the sky.<br>
    He also three times brought down fire.<br>
    4 How was you glorified, Elijah,<br>
    in your wondrous deeds!<br>
    Who can glory like you?<br>
    5 Who raised up a dead man from death,<br>
    and from Sheol, by the word of the Most High;<br>
    6 who brought kings down to destruction,<br>
    and honorable men from their bed;<br>
    7 who heard rebuke in Sinai,<br>
    and judgments of vengeance in Horeb;<br>
    8 who anointed kings to take retribution,<br>
    and prophets to succeed after him;<br>
    9 who was taken up in a storm of fire,<br>
    and in a chariot of fiery horses;<br>
    10 who was recorded for reproofs in their times,<br>
    to pacify wrath before it broke out into fury,<br>
    to turn the heart of the father to the son,<br>
    and to restore the tribes of Jacob.<br>
    11 Blessed are those who saw you,<br>
    and those who have been beautified with love;<br>
    for we also shall surely live.<br>
    12 Elijah it was, who was wrapped in a whirlwind;<br>
    but Elisha was filled with his spirit.<br>
    In all his days he didn’t tremble before any ruler,<br>
    and no one brought him into subjection.<br>
    13 Nothing was too high for him.<br>
    When he was buried, his body prophesied.<br>
    14 In his life, he did wonders;<br>
    and in death, he accomplished marvelous deeds.<br>
    15 For all this, the people didn’t repent,<br>
    and they didn’t depart from their sins,<br>
    until they were carried away as plunder from their land,<br>
    and were scattered through all the earth.<br>
    Yet there remained a small people,<br>
    and a ruler in the house of David.<br>
    16 Some of them did what was right,<br>
    but some sinned more and more.<br>
    17 Hezekiah fortified his city,<br>
    and brought water into the middle of it.<br>
    He dug through rock with iron,<br>
    and built wells for the waters.<br>
    18 In his days, Sennacherib came up,<br>
    and sent Rabshakeh.<br>
    He lifted up his hand against Zion,<br>
    and boasted grievously in his arrogance.<br>
    19 Then their hearts and hands trembled,<br>
    and they were in pain, like women in labor.<br>
    20 But they called upon the Lord who is merciful,<br>
    spreading out their hands to him;<br>
    and the Holy One quickly heard them from heaven,<br>
    and delivered them by the hand of Isaiah.<br>
    21 He struck the army of the Assyrians,<br>
    and his angel destroyed them.<br>
    22 For Hezekiah did what was pleasing to the Lord,<br>
    and was strong in the ways of David his father,<br>
    which Isaiah the prophet, who was great and faithful in his vision, commanded him.<br>
    23 In his days, the sun went backward;<br>
    and he added life to the king.<br>
    24 He saw by an excellent spirit what should come to pass at last,<br>
    and comforted those who mourned in Zion.<br>
    25 He revealed things to come,<br>
    and the hidden things before they happened.

  <h4>Psalm 141</h4>
  <p>
    1 Lord, I have called on you.<br>
    Come to me quickly!<br>
    Listen to my voice when I call to you.<br>
    2 Let my prayer be set before you like incense;<br>
    the lifting up of my hands like the evening sacrifice.<br>
    3 Set a watch, Lord, before my mouth.<br>
    Keep the door of my lips.<br>
    4 Don’t incline my heart to any evil thing,<br>
    to practice deeds of wickedness with men who work iniquity.<br>
    Don’t let me eat of their delicacies.<br>
    5 Let the righteous strike me, it is kindness;<br>
    let him reprove me, it is like oil on the head.<br>
    Don’t let my head refuse it;<br>
    yet my prayer is always against evil deeds.<br>
    6 Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock.<br>
    They will hear my words, for they are well spoken.<br>
    7 “As when one plows and breaks up the earth,<br>
    our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol.”<br>
    8 For my eyes are on you, Lord, the Lord.<br>
    In you, I take refuge. Don’t leave my soul destitute.<br>
    9 Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me,<br>
    from the traps of the workers of iniquity.<br>
    10 Let the wicked fall together into their own nets,<br>
    while I pass by.

  <h4>Psalm 142</h4>
  <p>
    1 I cry with my voice to the Lord.<br>
    With my voice, I ask the Lord for mercy.<br>
    2 I pour out my complaint before him.<br>
    I tell him my troubles.<br>
    3 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me,<br>
    you knew my route.<br>
    On the path in which I walk, they have hidden a snare for me.<br>
    4 Look on my right, and see;<br>
    for there is no one who is concerned for me.<br>
    Refuge has fled from me.<br>
    No one cares for my soul.<br>
    5 I cried to you, Lord.<br>
    I said, “You are my refuge,<br>
    my portion in the land of the living.”<br>
    6 Listen to my cry, for I am in desperate need.<br>
    Deliver me from my persecutors,<br>
    for they are stronger than me.<br>
    7 Bring my soul out of prison,<br>
    that I may give thanks to your name.<br>
    The righteous will surround me,<br>
    for you will be good to me.

  <h4>Psalm 143</h4>
  <p>
    1 Hear my prayer, Lord.<br>
    Listen to my petitions.<br>
    In your faithfulness and righteousness, relieve me.<br>
    2 Don’t enter into judgment with your servant,<br>
    for in your sight no man living is righteous.<br>
    3 For the enemy pursues my soul.<br>
    He has struck my life down to the ground.<br>
    He has made me live in dark places,<br>
    as those who have been long dead.<br>
    4 Therefore my spirit is overwhelmed within me.<br>
    My heart within me is desolate.<br>
    5 I remember the days of old.<br>
    I meditate on all your doings.<br>
    I contemplate the work of your hands.<br>
    6 I spread out my hands to you.<br>
    My soul thirsts for you, like a parched land.<br>
    Selah.<br>
    7 Hurry to answer me, Lord.<br>
    My spirit fails.<br>
    Don’t hide your face from me,<br>
    so that I don’t become like those who go down into the pit.<br>
    8 Cause me to hear your loving kindness in the morning,<br>
    for I trust in you.<br>
    Cause me to know the way in which I should walk,<br>
    for I lift up my soul to you.<br>
    9 Deliver me, Lord, from my enemies.<br>
    I flee to you to hide me.<br>
    10 Teach me to do your will,<br>
    for you are my God.<br>
    Your Spirit is good.<br>
    Lead me in the land of uprightness.<br>
    11 Revive me, Lord, for your name’s sake.<br>
    In your righteousness, bring my soul out of trouble.<br>
    12 In your loving kindness, cut off my enemies,<br>
    and destroy all those who afflict my soul,<br>
    for I am your servant.

    18 “There are three things which are too amazing for me,<br>
    four which I don’t understand:<br>
    19 The way of an eagle in the air,<br>
    the way of a serpent on a rock,<br>
    the way of a ship in the midst of the sea,<br>
    and the way of a man with a maiden.<br>
    20 So is the way of an adulterous woman:<br>
    She eats and wipes her mouth,<br>
    and says, ‘I have done nothing wrong.’<br>
    21 “For three things the earth trembles,<br>
    and under four, it can’t bear up:<br>
    22 for a servant when he is king,<br>
    a fool when he is filled with food,<br>
    23 for an unloved woman when she is married,<br>
    and a servant who is heir to her mistress.<br>
    24 “There are four things which are little on the earth,<br>
    but they are exceedingly wise:<br>
    25 the ants are not a strong people,<br>
    yet they provide their food in the summer;<br>
    26 the conies are but a feeble folk,<br>
    yet they make their houses in the rocks;<br>
    27 the locusts have no king,<br>
    yet they advance in ranks;<br>
    28 you can catch a lizard with your hands,<br>
    yet it is in kings’ palaces.<br>
    29 “There are three things which are stately in their march,<br>
    four which are stately in going:<br>
    30 The lion, which is mightiest among animals,<br>
    and doesn’t turn away for any;<br>
    31 the greyhound;<br>
    the male goat;<br>
    and the king against whom there is no rising up.<br>
    32 “If you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself,<br>
    or if you have thought evil,<br>
    put your hand over your mouth.<br>
    33 For as the churning of milk produces butter,<br>
    and the wringing of the nose produces blood;<br>

    1 The memory of Josiah is like the composition of incense<br>

    It is sweet as honey in every mouth,<br>
    and as music at a banquet of wine.<br>
    2 He behaved himself uprightly in the conversion of the people,<br>
    and took away the abominations of iniquity.<br>
    3 He set his heart right toward the Lord.<br>
    In the time of wicked men, he strengthened godliness.<br>
    4 Except David, Hezekiah, and Josiah,<br>
    all committed trespass;<br>
    for the kings of Judah abandoned the law of the Most High.<br>
    They despised the fear of God.<br>
    5 They gave their power to others,<br>
    and their glory to a foreign nation.<br>
    6 They set the chosen city of the sanctuary on fire,<br>
    and made her streets desolate,<br>
    as Jeremiah had said.<br>
    7 They mistreated him;<br>
    yet he was sanctified in his mother’s womb as a prophet,<br>
    to root out, and to afflict, and to destroy;<br>
    and to build and to plant.<br>
    8 Ezekiel saw the vision of glory,<br>
    which God showed him on the chariot of the cherubim.<br>
    9 For he made mention of the enemies under the figure of rain,<br>
    doing good to those who showed right ways.<br>
    10 May the bones of the twelve prophets flourish out of their place.<br>
    They comforted Jacob,<br>
    and delivered them with confident hope.<br>
    11 How shall we magnify Zerubbabel?<br>
    He was as a signet on the right hand.<br>
    12 So was Jeshua the son of Jozadak.<br>
    In their days, they built the house,<br>
    and raised a holy temple to the Lord,<br>
    prepared for everlasting glory.<br>
    13 Nehemiah’s memorial is great.<br>
    He raised up for us the walls that had fallen down.<br>
    He set up the gates and bars,<br>
    and rebuilt our houses again.<br>
    14 No one was created upon the earth like Enoch;<br>
    for he was taken up from the earth.<br>
    15 Neither was there a man like Joseph,<br>
    a leader of his brothers,<br>
    a supporter of the people;<br>
    and his bones were visited.<br>
    16 Shem and Seth were honored among men,<br>
    and Adam above every living thing in creation.

    4 He cared for his people not to fall,<br>

    he made the court of the sanctuary glorious.<br>
    12 And when he received the parts out of the priests’ hands,<br>
    he himself also stood by the hearth of the altar,<br>
    compassed with his brothers round about,<br>

    27 Jesus the son of Sirach of Jerusalem has written in this book<br>
    the instruction of understanding and knowledge,<br>
    who poured out wisdom from his heart.<br>
    28 Blessed is he who will be occupied in these things;<br>
    he who lays them up in his heart will become wise.<br>
    29 For if he does them, he will be strong for all things;<br>
    for the light of the Lord is his guide.

    3 He heals the broken in heart,<br>
    and binds up their wounds.<br>

    His understanding is infinite.<br>

    He brings the wicked down to the ground.<br>
    7 Sing to the Lord with thanksgiving.<br>
    Sing praises on the harp to our God,<br>
    8 who covers the sky with clouds,<br>
    who prepares rain for the earth,<br>
    who makes grass grow on the mountains.<br>
    9 He provides food for the livestock,<br>
    and for the young ravens when they call.<br>
    10 He doesn’t delight in the strength of the horse.<br>
    He takes no pleasure in the legs of a man.<br>
    11 The Lord takes pleasure in those who fear him,<br>
    in those who hope in his loving kindness.<br>

    14 He makes peace in your borders.<br>
    He fills you with the finest of the wheat.<br>
    15 He sends out his commandment to the earth.<br>
    His word runs very swiftly.<br>
    16 He gives snow like wool,<br>
    and scatters frost like ashes.<br>
    17 He hurls down his hail like pebbles.<br>
    Who can stand before his cold?<br>
    18 He sends out his word, and melts them.<br>
    He causes his wind to blow, and the waters flow.<br>
    19 He shows his word to Jacob,<br>
    his statutes and his ordinances to Israel.<br>
    20 He has not done this for just any nation.<br>
    They don’t know his ordinances.<br>

  <!-- Proverbs 31:10–31 -->
  <h3>Proverbs</h3>
  <h4>Proverbs 31:10–31</h4>
  <p>
    10 Who can find a worthy woman?<br>
    For her price is far above rubies.<br>
    11 The heart of her husband trusts in her.<br>
    He shall have no lack of gain.<br>
    12 She does him good, and not harm,<br>
    all the days of her life.<br>
    13 She seeks wool and flax,<br>
    and works eagerly with her hands.<br>
    14 She is like the merchant ships.<br>
    She brings her bread from afar.<br>
    15 She rises also while it is yet night,<br>
    gives food to her household,<br>
    and portions for her servant girls.<br>
    16 She considers a field, and buys it.<br>
    With the fruit of her hands, she plants a vineyard.<br>
    17 She arms her waist with strength,<br>
    and makes her arms strong.<br>
    18 She perceives that her merchandise is profitable.<br>
    Her lamp doesn’t go out by night.<br>
    19 She lays her hands to the distaff,<br>
    and her hands hold the spindle.<br>
    20 She opens her arms to the poor;<br>
    yes, she extends her hands to the needy.<br>
    21 She is not afraid of the snow for her household,<br>
    for all her household are clothed with scarlet.<br>
    22 She makes for herself carpets of tapestry.<br>
    Her clothing is fine linen and purple.<br>
    23 Her husband is respected in the gates,<br>
    when he sits among the elders of the land.<br>
    24 She makes linen garments and sells them,<br>
    and delivers sashes to the merchant.<br>
    25 Strength and dignity are her clothing.<br>
    She laughs at the time to come.<br>
    26 She opens her mouth with wisdom.<br>
    Kind instruction is on her tongue.<br>
    27 She looks well to the ways of her household,<br>
    and doesn’t eat the bread of idleness.<br>
    28 Her children rise up and call her blessed.<br>
    Her husband also praises her:<br>
    29 “Many women do noble things,<br>
    but you excel them all.”<br>
    30 Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain;<br>
    but a woman who fears the Lord, she shall be praised.<br>
    31 Give her of the fruit of her hands!<br>
    Let her works praise her in the gates!

  <h3>Sirach</h3>
  <h4>Sirach 51</h4>
  <p>
    1 I will give thanks to you, O Lord and King,<br>
    and will praise you, O God my Savior.<br>
    I do give thanks to your name;<br>
    2 for you were my protector and helper,<br>
    and delivered my body from destruction,<br>
    and from the snare of a slanderous tongue,<br>
    from lips that create lies;<br>
    and before those who stood by,<br>
    you were my helper.<br>
    3 And you delivered me,<br>
    according to the multitude of the mercy of your name,<br>
    from the roaring of those who were ready to devour me,<br>
    out of the hands of those who sought my life,<br>
    from the many afflictions which I had;<br>
    4 from the choking of a fire on every side,<br>
    and out of the midst of the fire which I didn’t kindle;<br>
    5 out of the deep belly of the grave;<br>
    from an unclean tongue, and lying words—<br>
    6 the slander of an unrighteous tongue came against me;<br>
    my soul drew near even to death,<br>
    my life was near to the grave beneath.<br>
    7 They surrounded me on every side,<br>
    and there was no one to help me.<br>
    I looked for help from men,<br>
    and there was none.<br>
    8 Then I remembered your mercy, O Lord,<br>
    and your work which has been of old,<br>
    how you deliver those who wait for you,<br>
    and save them out of the hand of the enemies.<br>
    9 I lifted up my prayer from the earth,<br>
    and prayed for deliverance from death.<br>
    10 I called upon the Lord, the Father of my Lord,<br>
    that he would not forsake me in the days of affliction,<br>
    in the time when there was no help against the proud.<br>
    11 I will praise your name continually,<br>
    and will sing praise with thanksgiving;<br>
    my prayer was heard,<br>
    12 for you saved me from destruction,<br>
    and delivered me from the evil time.<br>
    Therefore I will give thanks and praise you,<br>
    and bless the name of the Lord.<br>
    13 When I was yet young, before I went abroad,<br>
    I sought wisdom openly in my prayer.<br>
    14 Before the temple I asked for her.<br>
    I will search for her to the last.<br>
    15 From her blossoming to the ripening of her grape,<br>
    my heart has delighted in her.<br>
    My foot walked in the plain way;<br>
    from my youth I have known your teaching.<br>
    16 I inclined my ear a little, and received her,<br>
    and found for myself much instruction.<br>
    17 I profited in it.<br>
    I will give glory to him who gives me wisdom.<br>
    18 For I determined to practice her,<br>
    I was zealous for that which is good;<br>
    and I will never be put to shame.<br>
    19 My soul has wrestled in her,<br>
    and I was diligent to do her work.<br>
    I stretched out my hands to the heights,<br>
    and bewailed my ignorance of her.<br>
    20 I directed my soul to her,<br>
    and in pureness I found her.<br>
    I got understanding with her from the first.<br>
    Therefore I will not be forsaken.<br>
    21 My heart was stirred to seek her;<br>
    therefore I have gained a good possession.<br>
    22 The Lord gave me a tongue for my reward;<br>
    and I will praise him therewith.<br>
    23 Draw near to me, you unlearned,<br>
    and lodge in the house of instruction.<br>
    24 Say, “Why are you lacking in these things,<br>
    and your souls are very thirsty?”<br>
    25 I opened my mouth, and spoke,<br>
    “Buy her for yourselves without money.<br>
    26 Put your neck under the yoke,<br>
    and let your soul receive instruction.<br>
    She is near that you may find her.<br>
    27 Behold with your eyes how that I have labored a little,<br>
    and have found for myself much rest.<br>
    28 Get instruction with a great sum of silver,<br>
    and gain much gold by her.<br>
    29 May your soul rejoice in his mercy,<br>
    and may you not be put to shame when you praise him.<br>
    30 Work your work before the time comes,<br>
    and in his time he will give you your reward.”
