<h2>Day 1</h2>
<!-- Psalms 1, 2, 3 -->
<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 1</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Blessed is the man who doesn’t walk in the counsel of the wicked,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor stand on the path of sinners,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">nor sit in the seat of scoffers;</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> but his delight is in the Lord’s law.<br/>
<span class="indented">On his law he meditates day and night.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water,<br/>
<span class="indented">that produces its fruit in its season,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">whose leaf also does not wither.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Whatever he does shall prosper.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> The wicked are not so,<br/>
<span class="indented">but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> For the Lord knows the way of the righteous,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the way of the wicked shall perish.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 2</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Why do the nations rage<br/>
<span class="indented">and the peoples plot a vain thing?</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> The kings of the earth take a stand,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the rulers take counsel together,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">against the Lord and against his Anointed, saying,</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> “Let’s break their bonds apart<br/>
<span class="indented">and cast away their cords from us.”</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> He who sits in the heavens will laugh.<br/>
<span class="indented">The Lord will have them in derision.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Then he will speak to them in his anger<br/>
<span class="indented">and terrify them in his wrath:</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> “Yet I have set my King on my holy hill of Zion.”<br/>
<sup>7</sup> I will tell of the decree.<br/>
<span class="indented">The Lord said to me, “You are my son.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Today I have become your father.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Ask of me, and I will give the nations for your inheritance,<br/>
<span class="indented">the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> You shall break them with a rod of iron.<br/>
<span class="indented">You shall dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.”</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Now therefore be wise, you kings.<br/>
<span class="indented">Be instructed, you judges of the earth.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Serve the Lord with fear<br/>
<span class="indented">and rejoice with trembling.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Give sincere homage to the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish on the way,<br/>
<span class="indented">for his wrath may soon be kindled.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Blessed are all those who take refuge in him.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 3</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Lord, how my adversaries have increased!<br/>
<span class="indented">Many are those who rise up against me.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Many there are who say of my soul,<br/>
<span class="indented">“There is no help for him in God.”</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> But you, Lord, are a shield around me,<br/>
<span class="indented">my glory, and the one who lifts up my head.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> I cry to the Lord with my voice,<br/>
<span class="indented">and he answers me from his holy hill.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> I laid myself down and slept.<br/>
<span class="indented">I awakened, for the Lord sustains me.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people<br/>
<span class="indented">who have set themselves against me on every side.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Arise, Lord!<br/>
<span class="indented">Save me, my God!</span><br/>
<span class="indented">For you have struck all of my enemies on the cheek bone.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">You have broken the teeth of the wicked.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Salvation belongs to the Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">Your blessing be on your people.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 1:1–19 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 1:1–19</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel:<br/>
<sup>2</sup> to know wisdom and instruction,<br/>
<span class="indented">to discern the words of understanding,</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> to receive instruction in wise dealing,<br/>
<span class="indented">in righteousness, justice, and equity,</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> to give prudence to the simple,<br/>
<span class="indented">knowledge and discretion to the young man—</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> that the wise man may hear and increase in learning,<br/>
<span class="indented">that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsel,</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> to understand a proverb and parables,<br/>
<span class="indented">the words and riddles of the wise.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge,<br/>
<span class="indented">but fools despise wisdom and instruction.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> My son, listen to your father’s instruction,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching,</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> for they will be a garland to grace your head<br/>
<span class="indented">and chains around your neck.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> My son, if sinners entice you,<br/>
<span class="indented">don’t consent.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> If they say, “Come with us.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let’s lie in wait for blood.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Let’s lurk secretly for the innocent without cause.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Let’s swallow them up alive like Sheol,<br/>
<span class="indented">and whole, like those who go down into the pit.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> We’ll find all valuable wealth.<br/>
<span class="indented">We’ll fill our houses with plunder.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> You shall cast your lot among us.<br/>
<span class="indented">We’ll all have one purse.”</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> My son, don’t walk on the path with them.<br/>
<span class="indented">Keep your foot from their path,</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> for their feet run to evil,<br/>
<span class="indented">and they hurry to shed blood.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> For the net is spread in vain in the sight of any bird;<br/>
<sup>18</sup> but these lay in wait for their own blood.<br/>
<span class="indented">They lurk secretly for their own lives.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain.<br/>
<span class="indented">It takes away the life of its owners.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 1 -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 1</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> All wisdom comes from the Lord<br/>
<span class="indented">and is with him forever.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Who can count the sand of the seas,<br/>
<span class="indented">the drops of rain, and the days of eternity?</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Who will search out the height of heaven,<br/>
<span class="indented">the breadth of the earth, the deep, or wisdom?</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Wisdom has been created before all things,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the understanding of prudence from everlasting.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> The word of God Most High is the fountain of wisdom,<br/>
<span class="indented">and her ways are everlasting commandments.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> To whom has the root of wisdom been revealed?<br/>
<span class="indented">Who has known her shrewd counsels?</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> To whom has the knowledge of wisdom been manifested?<br/>
<span class="indented">Who has understood her great experience?</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> There is one who is wise, greatly to be feared,<br/>
<span class="indented">sitting upon his throne: the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> He created her, saw and measured her,<br/>
<span class="indented">and poured her out upon all his works.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> She is with all flesh according to his gift;<br/>
<span class="indented">he has given her freely to those who love him.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> The fear of the Lord is glory, exultation,<br/>
<span class="indented">and gladness, and a crown of rejoicing.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> The fear of the Lord will delight the heart,<br/>
<span class="indented">and will give gladness, joy, and length of days.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Whoever fears the Lord, it will go well with him at the last.<br/>
<span class="indented">He will be blessed in the day of his death.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> To fear the Lord is the beginning of wisdom;<br/>
<span class="indented">it was created together with the faithful in the womb.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> She laid an eternal foundation with mankind,<br/>
<span class="indented">and she will be trusted among their offspring.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> To fear the Lord is the fullness of wisdom,<br/>
<span class="indented">and she intoxicates men with her fruits.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> She will fill all their house with desirable things,<br/>
<span class="indented">and her storehouses with her increase.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> The fear of the Lord is the crown of wisdom,<br/>
<span class="indented">making peace and perfect health to flourish.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> He saw and measured her,<br/>
<span class="indented">rained down skill and knowledge of understanding,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and exalted the honor of those who hold her fast.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> The root of wisdom is to fear the Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">Its branches are length of days.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> Unjust wrath can never be justified,<br/>
<span class="indented">for a man’s wrath tips the scale to his ruin.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> A patient man will wait for a season,<br/>
<span class="indented">and afterward joy will spring up to him.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> He will hide his words until the right moment,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the lips of many will proclaim his understanding.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> The parables of knowledge are in the treasures of wisdom,<br/>
<span class="indented">but godliness is an abomination to a sinner.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> If you desire wisdom, keep the commandments,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the Lord will grant her to you freely;</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> for the fear of the Lord is wisdom and instruction.<br/>
<span class="indented">Faith and humility are his good pleasure.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> Don’t disobey the fear of the Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t come to him with a divided heart.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> Don’t be a hypocrite in the mouths of men.<br/>
<span class="indented">Keep watch over your lips.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> Don’t exalt yourself, lest you fall<br/>
<span class="indented">and bring dishonor upon your soul.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">The Lord will reveal your secrets</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and will cast you down in the midst of the congregation,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">because you didn’t come in the fear of the Lord,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and your heart was full of deceit.</span> </p></section>
<!-- ===================== DAY 2 ===================== -->
<section id="day 2">
<h2>Day 2</h2>
<!-- Psalms 4, 5, 6 -->
<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 4</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Answer me when I call, God of my righteousness!<br/>
<span class="indented">Give me relief from my distress.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Have mercy on me, and hear my prayer.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> You sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor?<br/>
<span class="indented">Will you love vanity and seek after falsehood?</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> But know that the Lord has set apart for himself<br/>
<span class="indented">him who is godly.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">The Lord will hear when I call to him.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Stand in awe, and don’t sin.<br/>
<span class="indented">Search your own heart on your bed, and be still.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Offer the sacrifices of righteousness.<br/>
<span class="indented">Put your trust in the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Many say, “Who will show us any good?”<br/>
<span class="indented">Lord, let the light of your face shine on us.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> You have put gladness in my heart,<br/>
<span class="indented">more than when their grain and their new wine are increased.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> In peace I will both lay myself down and sleep,<br/>
<span class="indented">for you alone, Lord, make me live in safety.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 5</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Give ear to my words, Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">Consider my meditation.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Listen to the voice of my cry, my King and my God;<br/>
<span class="indented">for I pray to you.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> In the morning, Lord, you will hear my voice.<br/>
<span class="indented">In the morning I will lay my requests before you, and will watch expectantly.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> For you are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness.<br/>
<span class="indented">Evil can’t live with you.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> The arrogant will not stand in your sight.<br/>
<span class="indented">You hate all workers of iniquity.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> You will destroy those who speak lies.<br/>
<span class="indented">The Lord abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> But as for me, in the abundance of your loving kindness I will come into your house.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will bow toward your holy temple in reverence of you.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Lead me, Lord, in your righteousness because of my enemies.<br/>
<span class="indented">Make your way straight before my face.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> For there is no faithfulness in their mouth.<br/>
<span class="indented">Their inward part is destruction.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Their throat is an open tomb.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">They flatter with their tongue.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Hold them guilty, God.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let them fall by their own counsels.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for they have rebelled against you.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> But let all those who take refuge in you rejoice.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let them always shout for joy, because you defend them.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Let them also who love your name be joyful in you.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> For you will bless the righteous.<br/>
<span class="indented">Lord, you will surround him with favor like a shield.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 6</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Lord, don’t rebuke me in your anger,<br/>
<span class="indented">neither discipline me in your wrath.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Have mercy on me, Lord, for I am faint.<br/>
<span class="indented">Lord, heal me, for my bones are troubled.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> My soul is also in great anguish.<br/>
<span class="indented">But you, Lord—how long?</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Return, Lord. Deliver my soul,<br/>
<span class="indented">and save me for your loving kindness’ sake.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> For in death there is no memory of you.<br/>
<span class="indented">In Sheol, who shall give you thanks?</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> I am weary with my groaning.<br/>
<span class="indented">Every night I flood my bed.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I drench my couch with my tears.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> My eye wastes away because of grief;<br/>
<span class="indented">it grows old because of all my adversaries.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity,<br/>
<span class="indented">for the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> The Lord has heard my supplication.<br/>
<span class="indented">The Lord accepts my prayer.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> May all my enemies be ashamed and dismayed.<br/>
<span class="indented">They shall turn back, they shall be disgraced suddenly.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 1:20–33 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 1:20–33</h4>
<p>
<sup>20</sup> Wisdom calls aloud in the street.<br/>
<span class="indented">She utters her voice in the public squares.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> She calls at the head of noisy places.<br/>
<span class="indented">At the entrance of the city gates, she utters her words:</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> “How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity?<br/>
<span class="indented">How long will mockers delight themselves in mockery,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and fools hate knowledge?</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Turn at my reproof.<br/>
<span class="indented">Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I will make known my words to you.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> Because I have called, and you have refused;<br/>
<span class="indented">I have stretched out my hand, and no one has paid attention;</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> but you have ignored all my counsel,<br/>
<span class="indented">and wanted none of my reproof;</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> I also will laugh at your disaster.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will mock when calamity overtakes you,</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> when calamity overtakes you like a storm,<br/>
<span class="indented">when your disaster comes on like a whirlwind,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">when distress and anguish come on you.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> Then they will call on me, but I will not answer.<br/>
<span class="indented">They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me,</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> because they hated knowledge,<br/>
<span class="indented">and didn’t choose the fear of the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> They wanted none of my counsel.<br/>
<span class="indented">They despised all my reproof.</span><br/>
<sup>31</sup> Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way,<br/>
<span class="indented">and be filled with their own schemes.</span><br/>
<sup>32</sup> For the backsliding of the simple will kill them.<br/>
<span class="indented">The careless ease of fools will destroy them.</span><br/>
<sup>33</sup> But whoever listens to me will dwell securely,<br/>
<span class="indented">and will be at ease, without fear of harm.”</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 2 -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 2</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> My son, if you come to serve the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">prepare your soul for temptation.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Set your heart aright, and constantly endure.<br/>
<span class="indented">Make not haste in time of calamity.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Cling to him, and don’t depart,<br/>
<span class="indented">that you may be increased at your latter end.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Accept whatever is brought upon you,<br/>
<span class="indented">and be patient when you suffer humiliation.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> For gold is tried in the fire,<br/>
<span class="indented">and acceptable men in the furnace of humiliation.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Put your trust in him, and he will help you.<br/>
<span class="indented">Make your ways straight, and set your hope on him.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> You who fear the Lord, wait for his mercy.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t turn aside, lest you fall.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> You who fear the Lord, believe him,<br/>
<span class="indented">and your reward will not fail.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> You who fear the Lord, hope for good<br/>
<span class="indented">and for everlasting joy and mercy.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Look at the generations of old, and see:<br/>
<span class="indented">Who ever trusted in the Lord, and was disappointed?</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Or who remained in his fear, and was forsaken?</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Or who called upon him, and he despised him?</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> For the Lord is full of compassion and mercy.<br/>
<span class="indented">He forgives sins and saves in time of affliction.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Woe to fearful hearts, and faint hands,<br/>
<span class="indented">and to the sinner who goes two ways!</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Woe to the faint heart! For it doesn’t believe.<br/>
<span class="indented">Therefore it won’t be defended.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Woe to you who have lost your patience!<br/>
<span class="indented">And what will you do when the Lord visits you?</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Those who fear the Lord will not disobey his words.<br/>
<span class="indented">Those who love him will keep his ways.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Those who fear the Lord will seek his good pleasure.<br/>
<span class="indented">Those who love him will be filled with the law.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Those who fear the Lord will prepare their hearts,<br/>
<span class="indented">and will humble their souls before him.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> We will fall into the hands of the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">and not into the hands of men;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for as his majesty is,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">so also is his mercy.</span> </p></section>

<span class="indented">if there is iniquity in my hands,</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> if I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me<br/>
<span class="indented">(yet I have delivered him who without cause was my adversary),</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it;<br/>
<span class="indented">yes, let him tread my life down to the earth,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and lay my glory in the dust.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Arise, Lord, in your anger.<br/>
<span class="indented">Lift up yourself against the rage of my adversaries.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Awake for me. You have commanded judgment.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Let the congregation of the peoples surround you.<br/>
<span class="indented">Rule over them on high.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> The Lord administers judgment to the peoples.<br/>
<span class="indented">Judge me, Lord, according to my righteousness,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and to my integrity that is in me.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end,<br/>
<span class="indented">but establish the righteous;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">their minds and hearts are searched by the righteous God.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> My shield is with God,<br/>
<span class="indented">who saves the upright in heart.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> God is a righteous judge,<br/>
<span class="indented">yes, a God who has indignation every day.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> If a man doesn’t repent, he will sharpen his sword;<br/>
<span class="indented">he has bent and strung his bow.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> He has also prepared for himself the instruments of death.<br/>
<span class="indented">He makes ready his flaming arrows.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Behold, he travails with iniquity.<br/>
<span class="indented">Yes, he has conceived mischief,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and brought out falsehood.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> He has dug a hole,<br/>
<span class="indented">and has fallen into the pit which he made.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> The trouble he causes shall return to his own head.<br/>
<span class="indented">His violence shall come down on the crown of his own head.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> I will give thanks to the Lord according to his righteousness,<br/>
<span class="indented">and will sing praise to the name of the Lord Most High.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 8</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!<br/>
<span class="indented">You have set your glory above the heavens!</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> From the lips of babes and infants you have established strength,<br/>

<span class="indented">What is the son of man, that you care for him?</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> For you have made him a little lower than the angels,<br/>
<span class="indented">and crowned him with glory and honor.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> You make him ruler over the works of your hands.<br/>
<span class="indented">You have put all things under his feet:</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> All sheep and cattle,<br/>
<span class="indented">yes, and the animals of the field,</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> the birds of the sky, the fish of the sea,<br/>
<span class="indented">and whatever passes through the paths of the seas.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Lord, our Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">how majestic is your name in all the earth!</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 9</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> I will give thanks to the Lord with my whole heart.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will tell of all your marvelous works.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> I will be glad and rejoice in you.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> When my enemies turn back,<br/>
<span class="indented">they stumble and perish in your presence.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> For you have maintained my just cause.<br/>
<span class="indented">You sit on the throne judging righteously.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> You have rebuked the nations.<br/>
<span class="indented">You have destroyed the wicked.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">You have blotted out their name forever and ever.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> The enemy is overtaken by endless ruin.<br/>
<span class="indented">The very memory of the cities which you have overthrown has perished.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> But the Lord reigns forever.<br/>
<span class="indented">He has prepared his throne for judgment.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> He will judge the world in righteousness.<br/>
<span class="indented">He will administer judgment to the peoples in uprightness.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> The Lord will also be a high tower for the oppressed,<br/>
<span class="indented">a high tower in times of trouble.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Those who know your name will put their trust in you,<br/>
<span class="indented">for you, Lord, have not forsaken those who seek you.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Sing praises to the Lord, who dwells in Zion,<br/>
<span class="indented">and declare among the people what he has done.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> For he who avenges blood remembers them.<br/>
<span class="indented">He doesn’t forget the cry of the afflicted.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Have mercy on me, Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">See my affliction by those who hate me,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and lift me up from the gates of death,</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> that I may show all of your praise.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will rejoice in your salvation in the gates of the daughter of Zion.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> The nations have sunk down in the pit that they made.<br/>
<span class="indented">In the net which they hid, their own foot is taken.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> The Lord has made himself known. He has executed judgment.<br/>
<span class="indented">The wicked is snared by the work of his own hands.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Meditation. Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> The wicked shall be turned back to Sheol,<br/>
<span class="indented">even all the nations that forget God.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> For the needy shall not always be forgotten,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor the hope of the poor perish forever.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> Arise, Lord! Don’t let man prevail.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let the nations be judged in your sight.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> Put them in fear, Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let the nations know that they are only men.</span><br/>

<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 2</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> My son, if you will receive my words,<br/>
<span class="indented">and store up my commandments within you,</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> so as to turn your ear to wisdom,<br/>
<span class="indented">and apply your heart to understanding;</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> yes, if you call out for discernment,<br/>
<span class="indented">and lift up your voice for understanding;</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> if you seek her as silver,<br/>
<span class="indented">and search for her as for hidden treasures:</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> then you will understand the fear of the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">and find the knowledge of God.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> For the Lord gives wisdom.<br/>
<span class="indented">Out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> He lays up sound wisdom for the upright.<br/>
<span class="indented">He is a shield to those who walk in integrity,</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> that he may guard the paths of justice,<br/>
<span class="indented">and preserve the way of his saints.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Then you will understand righteousness and justice,<br/>
<span class="indented">equity and every good path.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> For wisdom will enter into your heart.<br/>
<span class="indented">Knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Discretion will watch over you.<br/>
<span class="indented">Understanding will keep you,</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> to deliver you from the way of evil,<br/>
<span class="indented">from the men who speak perverse things,</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> who forsake the paths of uprightness,<br/>
<span class="indented">to walk in the ways of darkness,</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> who rejoice to do evil,<br/>
<span class="indented">and delight in the perverseness of evil,</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> who are crooked in their ways,<br/>
<span class="indented">and wayward in their paths,</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> to deliver you from the strange woman,<br/>
<span class="indented">even from the foreigner who flatters with her words,</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> who forsakes the friend of her youth,<br/>
<span class="indented">and forgets the covenant of her God;</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> for her house leads down to death,<br/>
<span class="indented">her paths to the departed spirits.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> None who go to her return again,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor do they attain to the paths of life.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> Therefore walk in the way of good men,<br/>
<span class="indented">and keep the paths of the righteous.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> For the upright will dwell in the land.<br/>
<span class="indented">The perfect will remain in it.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> But the wicked will be cut off from the land.<br/>
<span class="indented">The treacherous will be rooted out of it.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 3 -->

<h4>Sirach 3</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Hear me your father, O children,<br/>
<span class="indented">and do thereafter, that you may be saved.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> For the Lord has given the father glory concerning the children,<br/>
<span class="indented">and has confirmed the judgment of the mother over the sons.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> He who honors his father makes atonement for sins.<br/>
<sup>4</sup> He who gives glory to his mother is as one who lays up treasure.<br/>
<sup>5</sup> Whoever honors his father will have joy in his own children.<br/>
<span class="indented">He will be heard in the day of his prayer.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> He who gives glory to his father will have length of days.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who listens to the Lord will bring rest to his mother,</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> and will serve his parents as to masters.<br/>
<sup>8</sup> Honor your father in deed and word,<br/>
<span class="indented">that a blessing may come on you from him.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> For the blessing of the father establishes the houses of children,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the curse of the mother roots out the foundations.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Don’t glorify yourself in the dishonor of your father,<br/>
<span class="indented">for your father’s dishonor is no glory to you.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> For the glory of a man is from the honor of his father,<br/>
<span class="indented">and a mother in dishonor is a reproach to the children.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> My son, help your father in his old age,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t grieve him as long as he lives.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> If his understanding fails, have patience with him,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t dishonor him in your full strength.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> For the relieving of your father will not be forgotten.<br/>
<span class="indented">Instead of sins it will be added to build you up.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> In the day of your affliction it will remember you.<br/>
<span class="indented">Your sins also will melt away like frost in sunny weather.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> He who forsakes his father is as a blasphemer.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who provokes his mother is cursed by the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> My son, go on with your business in humility;<br/>
<span class="indented">so you will be loved by an acceptable man.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> The greater you are, the more humble yourself,<br/>
<span class="indented">and you will find favor before the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> Many are in high places, and of renown,<br/>
<span class="indented">but mysteries are revealed to the humble.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> For the power of the Lord is great,<br/>
<span class="indented">and he is glorified by those who are lowly.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> Don’t seek things that are too hard for you,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t search out things that are above your strength.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> Think about the things that have been commanded you,<br/>
<span class="indented">for you have no need of the things that are secret.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Don’t be overly busy in things that are beyond you,<br/>
<span class="indented">for more things are shown to you than men can understand.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> For the conceit of many has led them astray.<br/>
<span class="indented">Evil opinion has caused their judgment to slip.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> A stubborn heart will fare badly at the end.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who loves danger will perish in it.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> A stubborn heart will be loaded with troubles.<br/>
<span class="indented">The sinner will heap sin on sin.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> The calamity of the proud has no healing,<br/>
<span class="indented">for a weed of wickedness has taken root in him.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> The heart of the prudent will understand a parable.<br/>
<span class="indented">A wise man desires the ear of a listener.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> Water will quench a flaming fire,<br/>
<span class="indented">and giving alms will make atonement for sins.</span><br/>

<!-- Psalms 10, 11, 12, 13 -->
<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 10</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Why do you stand far off, Lord?<br/>
<span class="indented">Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> In arrogance, the wicked hunt down the weak.<br/>
<span class="indented">They are caught in the schemes that they devise.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> For the wicked boasts of his heart’s cravings.<br/>
<span class="indented">He blesses the greedy and condemns the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> The wicked, in the pride of his face, has no room in his thoughts for God.<br/>
<sup>5</sup> His ways are prosperous at all times.<br/>
<span class="indented">He is haughty, and your laws are far from his sight.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">As for all his adversaries, he sneers at them.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> He says in his heart, “I shall not be shaken.<br/>
<span class="indented">For generations I shall have no trouble.”</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and oppression.<br/>
<span class="indented">Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> He lies in wait near the villages.<br/>
<span class="indented">From ambushes, he murders the innocent.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">His eyes are secretly set against the helpless.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> He lurks in secret as a lion in his ambush.<br/>
<span class="indented">He lies in wait to catch the helpless.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He catches the helpless when he draws him in his net.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> The helpless are crushed. They collapse.<br/>
<span class="indented">They fall under his strength.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> He says in his heart, “God has forgotten.<br/>
<span class="indented">He hides his face. He will never see it.”</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Arise, Lord! God, lift up your hand!<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t forget the helpless.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Why does the wicked person condemn God,<br/>
<span class="indented">and say in his heart, “God won’t call me into account?”</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> But you do see trouble and grief.<br/>
<span class="indented">You consider it to take it into your hand.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">You help the victim and the fatherless.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Break the arm of the wicked.<br/>
<span class="indented">As for the evil man, seek out his wickedness until you find none.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> The Lord is King forever and ever!<br/>
<span class="indented">The nations will perish out of his land.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Lord, you have heard the desire of the humble.<br/>
<span class="indented">You will prepare their heart. You will cause your ear to hear,</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> to judge the fatherless and the oppressed,<br/>
<span class="indented">that man who is of the earth may terrify no more.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 11</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> In the Lord I take refuge.<br/>
<span class="indented">How can you say to my soul, “Flee as a bird to your mountain!”?</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> For behold, the wicked bend their bows.<br/>
<span class="indented">They set their arrows on the strings,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> If the foundations are destroyed,<br/>
<span class="indented">what can the righteous do?</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> The Lord is in his holy temple.<br/>
<span class="indented">The Lord is on his throne in heaven.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">His eyes observe. His eyes examine the children of men.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> The Lord examines the righteous,<br/>
<span class="indented">but his soul hates the wicked and him who loves violence.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> On the wicked he will rain blazing coals;<br/>
<span class="indented">fire, sulfur, and scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> For the Lord is righteous. He loves righteousness.<br/>
<span class="indented">The upright shall see his face.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 12</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Help, Lord; for the godly man ceases.<br/>
<span class="indented">For the faithful fail from among the children of men.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Everyone lies to his neighbor.<br/>
<span class="indented">They speak with flattering lips, and with a double heart.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> May the Lord cut off all flattering lips,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the tongue that boasts,</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> who have said, “With our tongue we will prevail.<br/>
<span class="indented">Our lips are our own. Who is lord over us?”</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> “Because of the oppression of the weak and because of the groaning of the needy,<br/>
<span class="indented">I will now arise,” says the Lord.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">“I will set him in safety from those who malign him.”</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> The Lord’s words are flawless words,<br/>
<span class="indented">as silver refined in a clay furnace, purified seven times.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> You will keep them, Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">You will preserve them from this generation forever.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> The wicked walk on every side,<br/>
<span class="indented">when what is vile is exalted among the sons of men.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 13</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> How long, Lord? Will you forget me forever?<br/>
<span class="indented">How long will you hide your face from me?</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> How long shall I take counsel in my soul,<br/>
<span class="indented">having sorrow in my heart every day?</span><br/>
<span class="indented">How long shall my enemy triumph over me?</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Behold, and answer me, Lord, my God.<br/>
<span class="indented">Give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death;</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> lest my enemy say, “I have prevailed against him;”<br/>
<span class="indented">lest my adversaries rejoice when I fall.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> But I trust in your loving kindness.<br/>
<span class="indented">My heart rejoices in your salvation.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> I will sing to the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">because he has been good to me.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 3:1–18 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 3:1–18</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> My son, don’t forget my teaching;<br/>
<span class="indented">but let your heart keep my commandments,</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> for they will add to you length of days,<br/>
<span class="indented">years of life, and peace.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Don’t let mercy and truth forsake you.<br/>
<span class="indented">Bind them around your neck.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Write them on the tablet of your heart.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> So you will find favor,<br/>
<span class="indented">and good understanding in the sight of God and man.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Trust in the Lord with all your heart,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t lean on your own understanding.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> In all your ways acknowledge him,<br/>
<span class="indented">and he will direct your paths.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Don’t be wise in your own eyes.<br/>
<span class="indented">Fear the Lord, and depart from evil.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> It will be health to your body,<br/>
<span class="indented">and nourishment to your bones.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Honor the Lord with your substance,<br/>
<span class="indented">with the first fruits of all your increase;</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> so your barns will be filled with plenty,<br/>
<span class="indented">and your vats will overflow with new wine.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> My son, don’t despise the Lord’s discipline,<br/>
<span class="indented">neither be weary of his reproof:</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> for whom the Lord loves, he reproves,<br/>
<span class="indented">even as a father reproves the son in whom he delights.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Happy is the man who finds wisdom,<br/>
<span class="indented">the man who gets understanding.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> For her good profit is better than getting silver,<br/>
<span class="indented">and her return is better than fine gold.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> She is more precious than rubies.<br/>
<span class="indented">None of the things you can desire are to be compared to her.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Length of days is in her right hand.<br/>
<span class="indented">In her left hand are riches and honor.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Her ways are ways of pleasantness.<br/>
<span class="indented">All her paths are peace.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her.<br/>
<span class="indented">Happy is everyone who retains her.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 4 -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 4</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> My son, don’t deprive the poor of his living.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t make the needy eyes wait long.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Don’t make a hungry soul sorrowful,<br/>
<span class="indented">or provoke a man in his distress.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Don’t add more trouble to a heart that is provoked.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t delay to give to him who is in need.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Don’t reject a supplicant in affliction.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t turn your face away from a poor man.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Don’t avert your eye from one who begs,<br/>
<span class="indented">and give him no occasion to curse you;</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> for if he curses you in the bitterness of his soul,<br/>
<span class="indented">he who made him will hear his prayer.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Endear yourself to the assembly.<br/>
<span class="indented">Bow your head to a great man.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Incline your ear to the poor,<br/>
<span class="indented">and answer him peaceably and gently.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Deliver him who is wronged from the hand of the wrongdoer.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t be hesitant in giving judgment.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Be as a father to the fatherless,<br/>
<span class="indented">and as a husband to their mother.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">So you will be as a son of the Most High,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and he will love you more than your mother does.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Wisdom exalts her children,<br/>
<span class="indented">and takes hold of those who seek her.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> He who loves her loves life.<br/>
<span class="indented">Those who seek her early will be filled with gladness.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> He who holds her fast will inherit glory.<br/>
<span class="indented">Wherever he enters, the Lord will bless.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Those who serve her will minister to the Holy One.<br/>
<span class="indented">The Lord loves those who love her.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> He who obeys her will judge the nations.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who gives heed to her will live securely.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> If a man trusts her, he will inherit her,<br/>
<span class="indented">and his generations will have her in possession.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> For at first she will walk with him in crooked ways,<br/>
<span class="indented">and bring fear and dread upon him,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and torment him with her discipline</span><br/>
<span class="indented">until she may trust his soul, and test him by her judgments.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> Then she will come straight back to him,<br/>
<span class="indented">and comfort him,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and reveal her secrets to him.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> If he goes astray, she will forsake him,<br/>
<span class="indented">and hand him over to his fall.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> Observe the opportunity, and beware of evil.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t be ashamed of your soul.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> For there is a shame that brings sin;<br/>
<span class="indented">and there is a shame that is glory and grace.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> Don’t show partiality against your soul,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t revere any man to your falling.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Don’t withhold a word in time of need.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t conceal your wisdom for beauty’s sake.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> For wisdom is known by speech,<br/>
<span class="indented">and instruction by the word of the tongue.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> In no way speak against the truth,<br/>
<span class="indented">and be ashamed of your ignorance.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> Don’t be ashamed to confess your sins.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t fight the river’s current.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> Don’t lay yourself down for a fool to tread upon.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t be partial to one who is mighty.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> Strive for the truth to death,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the Lord God will fight for you.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> Don’t be hasty in your words.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t be slack and remiss in your deeds.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> Don’t be like a lion in your house,<br/>
<span class="indented">or suspicious of your servants.</span><br/>
<sup>31</sup> Don’t let your hand be stretched out to receive,<br/>
<span class="indented">but shut when it is time to repay.</span> </p></section>

<h2>Day 5</h2>
<!-- Psalms 14, 15, 16, 17 -->
<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 14</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.”<br/>
<span class="indented">They are corrupt. They have done abominable deeds.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">There is no one who does good.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> The Lord looked down from heaven on the children of men,<br/>
<span class="indented">to see if there were any who understood,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">who sought after God.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> They have all gone aside. They have together become corrupt.<br/>
<span class="indented">There is no one who does good, no, not one.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge,<br/>
<span class="indented">who eat up my people as they eat bread,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t call on the Lord?</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> There they were in great fear,<br/>
<span class="indented">for God is in the generation of the righteous.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> You frustrate the plan of the poor,<br/>
<span class="indented">because the Lord is his refuge.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion!<br/>
<span class="indented">When the Lord restores the fortunes of his people,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">then Jacob shall rejoice,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and Israel shall be glad.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 15</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Lord, who shall dwell in your sanctuary?<br/>
<span class="indented">Who shall live on your holy hill?</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> He who walks blamelessly does what is right,<br/>
<span class="indented">and speaks truth in his heart;</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> he who doesn’t slander with his tongue,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor does evil to his friend,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">nor casts slurs against his fellow man;</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> in whose eyes a vile man is despised,<br/>
<span class="indented">but who honors those who fear the Lord;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">he who keeps an oath even when it hurts,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and doesn’t change;</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> he who doesn’t lend out his money for usury,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor take a bribe against the innocent.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He who does these things shall never be shaken.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 16</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Preserve me, God, for I take refuge in you.<br/>
<sup>2</sup> My soul, you have said to the Lord, “You are my Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">Apart from you I have no good thing.”</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> As for the saints who are in the earth,<br/>
<span class="indented">they are the excellent ones in whom is all my delight.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Their sorrows shall be multiplied who give gifts to another god.<br/>
<span class="indented">Their drink offerings of blood I will not offer,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">nor take their names on my lips.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> The Lord assigned my portion and my cup.<br/>
<span class="indented">You made my lot secure.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places.<br/>
<span class="indented">Yes, I have a good inheritance.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> I will bless the Lord, who has given me counsel.<br/>
<span class="indented">Yes, my heart instructs me in the night seasons.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> I have set the Lord always before me.<br/>
<span class="indented">Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Therefore my heart is glad, and my tongue rejoices.<br/>
<span class="indented">My body shall also dwell in safety.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> For you will not leave my soul in Sheol,<br/>
<span class="indented">neither will you allow your holy one to see corruption.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> You will show me the path of life.<br/>
<span class="indented">In your presence is fullness of joy.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">In your right hand there are pleasures forever more.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 17</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Hear, Lord, my righteous plea.<br/>
<span class="indented">Give ear to my prayer, that doesn’t go out of deceitful lips.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Let my sentence come out of your presence.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let your eyes look on equity.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> You have proved my heart. You have visited me in the night.<br/>
<span class="indented">You have tried me and found nothing.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I have resolved that my mouth shall not disobey.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> As for the deeds of men, by the word of your lips,<br/>
<span class="indented">I have kept myself from the ways of the violent.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> My steps have held fast to your paths.<br/>
<span class="indented">My feet have not slipped.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> I have called on you, for you will answer me, God.<br/>
<span class="indented">Turn your ear to me. Hear my speech.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Show your marvelous loving kindness,<br/>
<span class="indented">you who save those who take refuge by your right hand from their enemies.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Keep me as the apple of your eye.<br/>
<span class="indented">Hide me under the shadow of your wings,</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> from the wicked who oppress me,<br/>
<span class="indented">my deadly enemies, who surround me.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> They close up their callous hearts.<br/>
<span class="indented">With their mouth they speak proudly.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> They have now surrounded us in our steps.<br/>
<span class="indented">They set their eyes to cast us down to the earth.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey,<br/>
<span class="indented">as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Arise, Lord, confront him. Cast him down.<br/>
<span class="indented">Deliver my soul from the wicked by your sword,</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> from men by your hand, Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">from men of the world, whose portion is in this life.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">You fill the belly of your cherished ones.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Your sons have plenty, and they store up wealth for their children.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> As for me, I shall see your face in righteousness.<br/>
<span class="indented">I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with seeing your form.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 3:19–35 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 3:19–35</h4>
<p>
<sup>19</sup> By wisdom the Lord founded the earth.<br/>
<span class="indented">By understanding, he established the heavens.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> By his knowledge, the depths were broken up,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the skies drop down the dew.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> My son, let them not depart from your eyes.<br/>
<span class="indented">Keep sound wisdom and discretion,</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> so they will be life to your soul,<br/>
<span class="indented">and grace for your neck.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Then you shall walk in your way securely.<br/>
<span class="indented">Your foot won’t stumble.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> When you lie down, you will not be afraid.<br/>
<span class="indented">Yes, you will lie down, and your sleep will be sweet.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> Don’t be afraid of sudden fear,<br/>
<span class="indented">neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes;</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> for the Lord will be your confidence,<br/>
<span class="indented">and will keep your foot from being taken.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> Don’t withhold good from those to whom it is due,<br/>
<span class="indented">when it is in the power of your hand to do it.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> Don’t say to your neighbor, “Go, and come again;<br/>
<span class="indented">tomorrow I will give it to you,”</span><br/>
<span class="indented">when you have it by you.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> Don’t devise evil against your neighbor,<br/>
<span class="indented">since he dwells securely by you.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> Don’t strive with a man without cause,<br/>
<span class="indented">if he has done you no harm.</span><br/>
<sup>31</sup> Don’t envy the man of violence.<br/>
<span class="indented">Choose none of his ways.</span><br/>
<sup>32</sup> For the perverse is an abomination to the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">but his friendship is with the upright.</span><br/>
<sup>33</sup> The Lord’s curse is in the house of the wicked,<br/>
<span class="indented">but he blesses the habitation of the righteous.</span><br/>
<sup>34</sup> Surely he mocks the mockers,<br/>
<span class="indented">but he gives grace to the humble.</span><br/>
<sup>35</sup> The wise will inherit glory,<br/>
<span class="indented">but shame will be the promotion of fools.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 5 -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 5</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Don’t set your heart on your wealth.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t say, “I have enough for my life.”</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Don’t follow your own mind and your strength,<br/>
<span class="indented">to walk in the desires of your heart.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Don’t say, “Who will have dominion over me?”<br/>
<span class="indented">For the Lord will surely punish you.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Don’t say, “I sinned, and what happened to me?”<br/>
<span class="indented">For the Lord is patient.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Don’t be so sure of atonement<br/>
<span class="indented">that you add sin upon sins.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Don’t say, “His compassion is great.<br/>
<span class="indented">He will be pacified for the multitude of my sins,”</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for mercy and wrath are with him,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and his indignation will rest on sinners.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Don’t delay to turn to the Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t postpone it from day to day,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for suddenly the wrath of the Lord will come on you,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and you will perish in the time of vengeance.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Don’t set your heart on dishonest wealth,<br/>
<span class="indented">for it will profit you nothing in the day of calamity.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Don’t winnow with every wind.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t walk in every path.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">This is what the sinner who has a double tongue does.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Be steadfast in your understanding,<br/>
<span class="indented">and let your speech be consistent.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Be swift to hear,<br/>
<span class="indented">and answer with patience.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> If you have understanding, answer your neighbor;<br/>
<span class="indented">but if not, put your hand over your mouth.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Glory and dishonor come from speaking.<br/>
<span class="indented">A man’s tongue can be his downfall.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Don’t be called a whisperer.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t lie in wait with your tongue;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for shame is on the thief,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and an evil condemnation on the double-tongued.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> In a great or in a small matter, don’t be partial.
<h4>Sirach 6:1–17</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Don’t be an enemy instead of a friend;<br/>
<span class="indented">for an evil name will inherit shame and reproach.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">So it is with the sinner who has a double tongue.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Don’t exalt yourself in the counsel of your soul,<br/>
<span class="indented">that your soul not be torn in pieces like a bull.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> You will devour your leaves and destroy your fruit,<br/>
<span class="indented">and leave yourself like a dry tree.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> A wicked soul will destroy him who has it,<br/>
<span class="indented">and make him a laughing stock to his enemies.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> A pleasant voice multiplies friends.<br/>
<span class="indented">A gracious tongue multiplies courtesies.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Let those who are at peace with you be many,<br/>
<span class="indented">but let your counselors be one in a thousand.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> If you want to get a friend, test him,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t be in a hurry to trust him.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> For there is a friend who is so for his own occasion,<br/>
<span class="indented">and will not continue in the day of your affliction.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> There is also a friend who turns to enmity,<br/>
<span class="indented">and will reveal strife to your reproach.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Again, there is a friend who is a companion at the table,<br/>
<span class="indented">and will not continue in the day of your affliction.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> In your prosperity he will be as yourself,<br/>
<span class="indented">and will be bold over your servants.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> If you are brought low, he will be against you,<br/>
<span class="indented">and will hide himself from your face.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Separate yourself from your enemies,<br/>
<span class="indented">and beware of your friends.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> A faithful friend is a strong defense.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who has found him has found a treasure.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> There is nothing that can be taken in exchange for a faithful friend.<br/>
<span class="indented">His excellency is beyond price.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> A faithful friend is a medicine of life.<br/>
<span class="indented">Those who fear the Lord will find him.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> He who fears the Lord directs his friendship properly,<br/>
<span class="indented">for as he is, so is his neighbor also.</span></p><br/>

<h2>Day 6</h2>
<!-- Psalms 18 -->
<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 18</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> I love you, Lord, my strength.<br/>
<sup>2</sup> The Lord is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer;<br/>
<span class="indented">my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> I call on the Lord, who is worthy to be praised;<br/>
<span class="indented">and I am saved from my enemies.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> The cords of death surrounded me.<br/>
<span class="indented">The floods of ungodliness made me afraid.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> The cords of Sheol were around me.<br/>
<span class="indented">The snares of death came on me.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> In my distress I called on the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">and cried to my God.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He heard my voice out of his temple.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">My cry before him came into his ears.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Then the earth shook and trembled.<br/>
<span class="indented">The foundations also of the mountains quaked and were shaken,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">because he was angry.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Smoke went out of his nostrils.<br/>
<span class="indented">Consuming fire came out of his mouth.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Coals were kindled by it.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> He bowed the heavens also, and came down.<br/>
<span class="indented">Thick darkness was under his feet.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> He rode on a cherub, and flew.<br/>
<span class="indented">Yes, he soared on the wings of the wind.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> He made darkness his hiding place, his pavilion around him,<br/>
<span class="indented">darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed,<br/>
<span class="indented">hailstones and coals of fire.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> The Lord also thundered in the sky.<br/>
<span class="indented">The Most High uttered his voice—</span><br/>
<span class="indented">hailstones and coals of fire.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> He sent out his arrows, and scattered them.<br/>
<span class="indented">He hurled lightning, and routed them.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Then the channels of waters appeared.<br/>
<span class="indented">The foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke, Lord,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> He sent from on high. He took me.<br/>
<span class="indented">He drew me out of many waters.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> He delivered me from my strong enemy,<br/>
<span class="indented">from those who hated me; for they were too mighty for me.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> They came on me in the day of my calamity,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the Lord was my support.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> He brought me out also into a large place.<br/>
<span class="indented">He delivered me, because he delighted in me.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> The Lord has rewarded me according to my righteousness.<br/>
<span class="indented">According to the cleanness of my hands he has repaid me.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> For I have kept the ways of the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">and have not wickedly departed from my God.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> For all his ordinances were before me.<br/>
<span class="indented">I didn’t put away his statutes from me.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> I was also blameless with him.<br/>
<span class="indented">I kept myself from my iniquity.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> Therefore the Lord has rewarded me according to my righteousness,<br/>
<span class="indented">according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> With the merciful you will show yourself merciful.<br/>
<span class="indented">With the perfect man, you will show yourself perfect.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> With the pure, you will show yourself pure.<br/>
<span class="indented">With the crooked you will show yourself shrewd.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> For you will save the afflicted people,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the arrogant eyes you will bring down.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> For you will light my lamp, Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">My God will light up my darkness.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> For by you, I advance through a troop.<br/>
<span class="indented">By my God, I leap over a wall.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> As for God, his way is perfect.<br/>
<span class="indented">The Lord’s word is tried.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.</span><br/>
<sup>31</sup> For who is God, except the Lord?<br/>
<span class="indented">Who is a rock besides our God,</span><br/>
<sup>32</sup> the God who arms me with strength, and makes my way perfect?<br/>
<sup>33</sup> He makes my feet like deer’s feet,<br/>
<span class="indented">and sets me on my high places.</span><br/>
<sup>34</sup> He teaches my hands to war,<br/>
<span class="indented">so that my arms bend a bow of bronze.</span><br/>
<sup>35</sup> You have also given me the shield of your salvation.<br/>
<span class="indented">Your right hand sustains me.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Your gentleness has made me great.</span><br/>
<sup>36</sup> You have enlarged my steps under me,<br/>
<span class="indented">and my feet have not slipped.</span><br/>
<sup>37</sup> I will pursue my enemies, and overtake them.<br/>
<span class="indented">I won’t turn away until they are consumed.</span><br/>
<sup>38</sup> I will strike them through, so that they will not be able to rise.<br/>
<span class="indented">They shall fall under my feet.</span><br/>
<sup>39</sup> For you have armed me with strength to the battle.<br/>
<span class="indented">You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.</span><br/>
<sup>40</sup> You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me,<br/>
<span class="indented">that I might cut off those who hate me.</span><br/>
<sup>41</sup> They cried, but there was no one to save;<br/>
<span class="indented">even to the Lord, but he didn’t answer them.</span><br/>
<sup>42</sup> Then I beat them small as the dust before the wind.<br/>
<span class="indented">I cast them out as the mire of the streets.</span><br/>
<sup>43</sup> You have delivered me from the strivings of the people.<br/>
<span class="indented">You have made me the head of the nations.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">A people whom I have not known shall serve me.</span><br/>
<sup>44</sup> As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me.<br/>
<span class="indented">The foreigners shall submit themselves to me.</span><br/>
<sup>45</sup> The foreigners shall fade away,<br/>
<span class="indented">and shall come trembling out of their strongholds.</span><br/>
<sup>46</sup> The Lord lives! Blessed be my rock.<br/>
<span class="indented">Exalted be the God of my salvation,</span><br/>
<sup>47</sup> even the God who executes vengeance for me,<br/>
<span class="indented">and subdues peoples under me.</span><br/>
<sup>48</sup> He rescues me from my enemies.<br/>
<span class="indented">Yes, you lift me up above those who rise up against me.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">You deliver me from the violent man.</span><br/>
<sup>49</sup> Therefore I will give thanks to you, Lord, among the nations,<br/>
<span class="indented">and will sing praises to your name.</span><br/>
<sup>50</sup> He gives great deliverance to his king,<br/>
<span class="indented">and shows loving kindness to his anointed,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">to David and to his offspring forever more.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 4:1–9 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 4:1–9</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Listen, sons, to a father’s instruction.<br/>
<span class="indented">Pay attention to know understanding;</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> for I give you sound learning.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t forsake my law.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> For I was a son to my father,<br/>
<span class="indented">tender and an only child in the sight of my mother.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> He taught me, and said to me:<br/>
<span class="indented">“Let your heart retain my words.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Keep my commandments, and live.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Get wisdom. Get understanding.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t forget, and don’t deviate from the words of my mouth.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Don’t forsake her, and she will preserve you.<br/>
<span class="indented">Love her, and she will keep you.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Wisdom is supreme. Get wisdom.<br/>
<span class="indented">Yes, though it costs all your possessions, get understanding.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Esteem her, and she will exalt you.<br/>
<span class="indented">She will bring you honor when you embrace her.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> She will give to your head a garland of grace.<br/>
<span class="indented">She will deliver a crown of splendor to you.”</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 6 -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 6:18–37</h4>
<p>
<sup>18</sup> My son, gather instruction from your youth up.<br/>
<span class="indented">So you will find wisdom until you grow old.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> Come to her as one who plows and sows,<br/>
<span class="indented">and wait for her good fruits;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for you will toil a little in her work,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and will quickly eat of her fruits.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> She is very unpleasant to the unlearned.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who is without understanding will not remain in her.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> She will rest upon him as a mighty stone of trial.<br/>
<span class="indented">He will not delay to cast her from him.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> For wisdom is according to her name,<br/>
<span class="indented">and is not manifest to many.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Listen, my son, and receive my instruction.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t refuse my counsel.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> Put your feet into her fetters,<br/>
<span class="indented">and your neck into her chain.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> Put your shoulder under her and bear her.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t be grieved with her bonds.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> Come to her with all your soul,<br/>
<span class="indented">and keep her ways with all your power.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> Search and seek, and she will be made known to you.<br/>
<span class="indented">When you get hold of her, don’t let her go.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> For at the last you will find her rest,<br/>
<span class="indented">and she will be turned into your joy.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> Then her fetters will be a strong defense for you,<br/>
<span class="indented">and her chains a robe of glory.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> For there is a golden ornament on her,<br/>
<span class="indented">and her bonds are blue lace.</span><br/>
<sup>31</sup> You will wear her as a glorious robe,<br/>
<span class="indented">and put her on as a crown of gladness.</span><br/>
<sup>32</sup> My son, if you will, you will be instructed.<br/>
<span class="indented">If you will yield your soul, you will be prudent.</span><br/>
<sup>33</sup> If you love to hear, you will receive.<br/>
<span class="indented">If you incline your ear, you will be wise.</span><br/>
<sup>34</sup> Stand in the multitude of the elders.<br/>
<span class="indented">Attach yourself to whoever is wise.</span><br/>
<sup>35</sup> Be willing to listen to every godly discourse.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t let the proverbs of understanding escape you.</span><br/>
<sup>36</sup> If you see a man of understanding, get early to him.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let your foot wear out the steps of his doors.</span><br/>
<sup>37</sup> Let your mind dwell on the ordinances of the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">and meditate continually on his commandments.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He will establish your heart,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and your desire for wisdom will be given to you.</span> </p></section>

<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 19</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> The heavens declare the glory of God.<br/>

<sup>3</sup> There is no speech nor language<br/>
<span class="indented">where their voice is not heard.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Their voice has gone out through all the earth,<br/>
<span class="indented">their words to the end of the world.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">In them he has set a tent for the sun,</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> which is as a bridegroom coming out of his room,<br/>
<span class="indented">like a strong man rejoicing to run his course.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> His going out is from the end of the heavens,<br/>
<span class="indented">his circuit to its ends.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">There is nothing hidden from its heat.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> The Lord’s law is perfect, restoring the soul.<br/>
<span class="indented">The Lord’s testimony is sure, making wise the simple.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> The Lord’s precepts are right, rejoicing the heart.<br/>
<span class="indented">The Lord’s commandment is pure, enlightening the eyes.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever.<br/>
<span class="indented">The Lord’s ordinances are true, and righteous altogether.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> They are more to be desired than gold, yes, than much fine gold,<br/>
<span class="indented">sweeter also than honey and the extract of the honeycomb.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Moreover your servant is warned by them.<br/>
<span class="indented">In keeping them there is great reward.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Who can discern his errors?<br/>
<span class="indented">Forgive me from hidden errors.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let them not have dominion over me.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Then I will be upright.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I will be blameless and innocent of great transgression.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart<br/>
<span class="indented">be acceptable in your sight,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Lord, my rock, and my redeemer.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 20</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> May the Lord answer you in the day of trouble.<br/>
<span class="indented">May the name of the God of Jacob set you up on high,</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> send you help from the sanctuary,<br/>
<span class="indented">grant you support from Zion,</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> remember all your offerings,<br/>
<span class="indented">and accept your burnt sacrifice.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> May he grant you your heart’s desire,<br/>
<span class="indented">and fulfill all your counsel.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> We will triumph in your salvation.<br/>
<span class="indented">In the name of our God, we will set up our banners.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">May the Lord grant all your requests.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Now I know that the Lord saves his anointed.<br/>
<span class="indented">He will answer him from his holy heaven,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">with the saving strength of his right hand.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Some trust in chariots, and some in horses,<br/>
<span class="indented">but we trust the name of the Lord our God.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> They are bowed down and fallen,<br/>
<span class="indented">but we rise up, and stand upright.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Save, Lord!<br/>
<span class="indented">Let the King answer us when we call!</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 21</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> The king rejoices in your strength, Lord!<br/>
<span class="indented">How greatly he rejoices in your salvation!</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> You have given him his heart’s desire,<br/>
<span class="indented">and have not withheld the request of his lips.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> For you meet him with the blessings of goodness.<br/>
<span class="indented">You set a crown of fine gold on his head.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> He asked life of you, and you gave it to him,<br/>
<span class="indented">even length of days forever and ever.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> His glory is great in your salvation.<br/>
<span class="indented">You lay honor and majesty on him.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> For you make him most blessed forever.<br/>
<span class="indented">You make him glad with joy in your presence.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> For the king trusts in the Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">Through the loving kindness of the Most High, he shall not be moved.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Your hand will find out all of your enemies.<br/>
<span class="indented">Your right hand will find out those who hate you.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> You will make them as a fiery furnace in the time of your anger.<br/>
<span class="indented">The Lord will swallow them up in his wrath.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">The fire shall devour them.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> You will destroy their descendants from the earth,<br/>
<span class="indented">their posterity from among the children of men.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> For they intended evil against you.<br/>
<span class="indented">They plotted evil against you which cannot succeed.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> For you will make them turn their back<br/>
<span class="indented">when you aim drawn bows at their face.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Be exalted, Lord, in your strength,<br/>
<span class="indented">so we will sing and praise your power.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 4:10–27 -->

<h2>Day 8</h2>
<!-- Psalms 22, 23, 24 -->
<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 22</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?<br/>
<span class="indented">Why are you so far from helping me, and from the words of my groaning?</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> My God, I cry in the daytime, but you don’t answer;<br/>
<span class="indented">in the night season, and am not silent.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> But you are holy,<br/>
<span class="indented">you who inhabit the praises of Israel.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Our fathers trusted in you.<br/>
<span class="indented">They trusted, and you delivered them.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> They cried to you, and were delivered.<br/>
<span class="indented">They trusted in you, and were not disappointed.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> But I am a worm, and no man;<br/>
<span class="indented">a reproach of men, and despised by the people.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> All those who see me mock me.<br/>
<span class="indented">They insult me with their lips. They shake their heads, saying,</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> “He trusts in the Lord. Let him deliver him.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let him rescue him, since he delights in him.”</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> But you brought me out of the womb.<br/>
<span class="indented">You made me trust at my mother’s breasts.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> I was thrown on you from my mother’s womb.<br/>
<span class="indented">You are my God since my mother bore me.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Don’t be far from me, for trouble is near.<br/>
<span class="indented">For there is no one to help.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Many bulls have surrounded me.<br/>
<span class="indented">Strong bulls of Bashan have encircled me.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> They open their mouths wide against me,<br/>
<span class="indented">lions tearing prey and roaring.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> I am poured out like water.<br/>
<span class="indented">All my bones are out of joint.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">My heart is like wax.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">It is melted within me.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> My strength is dried up like a potsherd.<br/>
<span class="indented">My tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">You have brought me into the dust of death.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> For dogs have surrounded me.<br/>
<span class="indented">A company of evildoers have enclosed me.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">They have pierced my hands and feet.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> I can count all of my bones.<br/>
<span class="indented">They look and stare at me.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> They divide my garments among them.<br/>
<span class="indented">They cast lots for my clothing.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> But don’t be far off, Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">You are my help. Hurry to help me.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> Deliver my soul from the sword,<br/>
<span class="indented">my precious life from the power of the dog.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> Save me from the lion’s mouth!<br/>
<span class="indented">Yes, you have rescued me from the horns of the wild oxen.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> I will declare your name to my brothers.<br/>
<span class="indented">Among the assembly, I will praise you.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> You who fear the Lord, praise him!<br/>
<span class="indented">All you descendants of Jacob, glorify him!</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Stand in awe of him, all you descendants of Israel!</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> For he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted,<br/>
<span class="indented">neither has he hidden his face from him;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">but when he cried to him, he heard.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> My praise of you comes in the great assembly.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will pay my vows before those who fear him.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> The humble shall eat and be satisfied.<br/>
<span class="indented">They shall praise the Lord who seek after him.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Let your hearts live forever.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">All the relatives of the nations shall worship before you.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> For the kingdom is the Lord’s.<br/>
<span class="indented">He is the ruler over the nations.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> All the rich ones of the earth shall eat and worship.<br/>
<span class="indented">All those who go down to the dust shall bow before him,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">even he who can’t keep his soul alive.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> Posterity shall serve him.<br/>
<span class="indented">Future generations shall be told about the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>31</sup> They shall come and shall declare his righteousness to a people that shall be born,<br/>
<span class="indented">for he has done it.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 23</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> The Lord is my shepherd:<br/>
<span class="indented">I shall lack nothing.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> He makes me lie down in green pastures.<br/>
<span class="indented">He leads me beside still waters.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> He restores my soul.<br/>
<span class="indented">He guides me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,<br/>
<span class="indented">I will fear no evil, for you are with me.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.<br/>
<span class="indented">You anoint my head with oil.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">My cup runs over.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Surely goodness and loving kindness shall follow me all the days of my life,<br/>
<span class="indented">and I will dwell in the Lord’s house forever.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 24</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> The earth is the Lord’s, with its fullness;<br/>
<span class="indented">the world, and those who dwell in it.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> For he has founded it on the seas,<br/>
<span class="indented">and established it on the floods.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Who may ascend to the Lord’s hill?<br/>
<span class="indented">Who may stand in his holy place?</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> He who has clean hands and a pure heart;<br/>
<span class="indented">who has not lifted up his soul to falsehood,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and has not sworn deceitfully.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> He shall receive a blessing from the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">righteousness from the God of his salvation.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> This is the generation of those who seek Him,<br/>
<span class="indented">who seek your face—even Jacob.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Lift up your heads, you gates!<br/>
<span class="indented">Be lifted up, you everlasting doors,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and the King of glory will come in.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Who is the King of glory?<br/>
<span class="indented">The Lord strong and mighty,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">the Lord mighty in battle.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Lift up your heads, you gates;<br/>
<span class="indented">yes, lift them up, you everlasting doors,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and the King of glory will come in.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Who is this King of glory?<br/>
<span class="indented">The Lord of Armies</span><br/>
<span class="indented">is the King of glory!</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 5:1–14 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 5:1–14</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> My son, pay attention to my wisdom.<br/>
<span class="indented">Turn your ear to my understanding,</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> that you may maintain discretion,<br/>
<span class="indented">that your lips may preserve knowledge.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> For the lips of an adulteress drip honey.<br/>
<span class="indented">Her mouth is smoother than oil,</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> but in the end she is as bitter as wormwood,<br/>
<span class="indented">and as sharp as a two-edged sword.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Her feet go down to death.<br/>
<span class="indented">Her steps lead straight to Sheol.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> She gives no thought to the way of life.<br/>
<span class="indented">Her ways are crooked, and she doesn’t know it.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Now therefore, my sons, listen to me.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t depart from the words of my mouth.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Remove your way far from her.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t come near the door of her house,</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> lest you give your honor to others,<br/>
<span class="indented">and your years to the cruel one;</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> lest strangers feast on your wealth,<br/>
<span class="indented">and your labors enrich another man’s house.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> You will groan at your latter end,<br/>
<span class="indented">when your flesh and your body are consumed,</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> and say, “How I have hated instruction,<br/>
<span class="indented">and my heart despised reproof;</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor turned my ear to those who instructed me!</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> I have come to the brink of utter ruin,<br/>
<span class="indented">among the gathered assembly.”</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 8 -->

<h4>Sirach 8</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Don’t strive with a mighty man,<br/>
<span class="indented">lest perhaps you fall into his hands.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Don’t contend with a rich man,<br/>
<span class="indented">lest he overpower you;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for gold has destroyed many,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and perverts the hearts of kings.</span><br/>

<span class="indented">and don’t heap wood on his fire.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Don’t jest with a rude man,<br/>
<span class="indented">lest your ancestors be disgraced.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Don’t reproach a man when he turns from sin.<br/>
<span class="indented">Remember that we are all worthy of punishment.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Don’t dishonor a man in his old age,<br/>
<span class="indented">for some of us are also growing old.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Don’t rejoice over one who is dead,<br/>
<span class="indented">but remember that we all die.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Don’t neglect the discourse of the wise,<br/>
<span class="indented">but acquaint yourself with their proverbs;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for from them you will learn instruction,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">how to minister to great men.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Don’t miss the discourse of the aged,<br/>
<span class="indented">for they also learned from their fathers;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">because from them you will learn understanding,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and to give an answer in time of need.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Don’t kindle the coals of a sinner,<br/>
<span class="indented">lest you be burned with the flame of his fire.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Don’t rise up against the presence of an injurious man,<br/>
<span class="indented">lest he lie in wait like a trap for your mouth.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Don’t lend to a man who is mightier than yourself.<br/>
<span class="indented">If you lend anything, count it as lost.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Don’t guarantee beyond your ability.<br/>
<span class="indented">If you guarantee, think as one who will have to pay.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Don’t go to law with a judge,<br/>
<span class="indented">for according to his honor they will give judgment for him.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Don’t travel with a reckless fellow,<br/>
<span class="indented">lest he be burdensome to you;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for he will do according to his own will,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and you will perish with him through his folly.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Don’t fight with a wrathful man.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t travel with him through the desert,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for blood is as nothing in his sight;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and where there is no help, he will overthrow you.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Don’t take counsel with a fool,<br/>
<span class="indented">for he can’t keep a secret.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> Do no secret thing before a stranger,<br/>
<span class="indented">for you don’t know what it will generate.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> Don’t open your heart to every man.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t let him return you a favor.</span> </p></section>

<sup>5</sup> Guide me in your truth, and teach me,<br/>
<span class="indented">For you are the God of my salvation,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I wait for you all day long.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Lord, remember your tender mercies and your loving kindness,<br/>
<span class="indented">for they are from old times.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Don’t remember the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions.<br/>
<span class="indented">Remember me according to your loving kindness,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for your goodness’ sake, Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Good and upright is the Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">Therefore he will instruct sinners in the way.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> He will guide the humble in justice.<br/>
<span class="indented">He will teach the humble his way.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> All the paths of the Lord are loving kindness and truth<br/>
<span class="indented">to such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> For your name’s sake, Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">pardon my iniquity, for it is great.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> What man is he who fears the Lord?<br/>
<span class="indented">He shall instruct him in the way that he shall choose.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> His soul will dwell at ease.<br/>
<span class="indented">His offspring will inherit the land.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> The friendship of the Lord is with those who fear him.<br/>
<span class="indented">He will show them his covenant.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> My eyes are ever on the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">for he will pluck my feet out of the net.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Turn to me, and have mercy on me,<br/>
<span class="indented">for I am desolate and afflicted.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> The troubles of my heart are enlarged.<br/>
<span class="indented">Oh bring me out of my distresses.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> Consider my affliction and my travail.<br/>
<span class="indented">Forgive all my sins.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> Consider my enemies, for they are many.<br/>
<span class="indented">They hate me with cruel hatred.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> Oh keep my soul, and deliver me.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let me not be disappointed, for I take refuge in you.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> Let integrity and uprightness preserve me,<br/>
<span class="indented">for I wait for you.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> Redeem Israel, God,<br/>
<span class="indented">out of all his troubles.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 26</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Judge me, Lord, for I have walked in my integrity.<br/>
<span class="indented">I have trusted also in the Lord without wavering.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Examine me, Lord, and prove me.<br/>
<span class="indented">Try my heart and my mind.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> For your loving kindness is before my eyes.<br/>
<span class="indented">I have walked in your truth.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> I have not sat with deceitful men,<br/>
<span class="indented">neither will I go in with hypocrites.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> I hate the assembly of evildoers,<br/>
<span class="indented">and will not sit with the wicked.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> I will wash my hands in innocence,<br/>
<span class="indented">so I will go about your altar, Lord;</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> that I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard<br/>
<span class="indented">and tell of all your wondrous deeds.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Lord, I love the habitation of your house,<br/>
<span class="indented">the place where your glory dwells.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Don’t gather my soul with sinners,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor my life with bloodthirsty men;</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> in whose hands is wickedness;<br/>
<span class="indented">their right hand is full of bribes.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> But as for me, I will walk in my integrity.<br/>
<span class="indented">Redeem me, and be merciful to me.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> My foot stands in an even place.<br/>
<span class="indented">In the congregations I will bless the Lord.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 27</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> The Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom shall I fear?<br/>
<span class="indented">The Lord is the strength of my life. Of whom shall I be afraid?</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> When evildoers came at me to eat up my flesh,<br/>
<span class="indented">even my adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Though an army should encamp against me,<br/>
<span class="indented">my heart shall not fear.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Though war should rise against me,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">even then I will be confident.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> One thing I have asked of the Lord, that I will seek after:<br/>
<span class="indented">that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">to see the Lord’s beauty,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and to inquire in his temple.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> For in the day of trouble he will keep me secretly in his pavilion.<br/>
<span class="indented">In the covert of his tent he will hide me.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He will lift me up on a rock.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will offer sacrifices of joy in his tent.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Hear, Lord, when I cry with my voice.<br/>
<span class="indented">Have mercy also on me, and answer me.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> When you said, “Seek my face,”<br/>
<span class="indented">my heart said to you, “I will seek your face, Lord.”</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Don’t hide your face from me.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t put your servant away in anger.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">You have been my help.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t abandon me, neither forsake me, God of my salvation.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> When my father and my mother forsake me,<br/>
<span class="indented">then the Lord will take me up.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Teach me your way, Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">Lead me in a straight path, because of my enemies.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Don’t deliver me over to the desire of my adversaries,<br/>
<span class="indented">for false witnesses have risen up against me,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">such as breathe out cruelty.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> I am still confident of this:<br/>
<span class="indented">I will see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Wait for the Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">Be strong, and let your heart take courage.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Yes, wait for the Lord.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 5:15–23 -->

<h4>Proverbs 5:15–23</h4>
<p>
<sup>15</sup> Drink water out of your own cistern,<br/>
<span class="indented">running water out of your own well.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Should your springs overflow in the streets,<br/>
<span class="indented">streams of water in the public squares?</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Let them be for yourself alone,<br/>
<span class="indented">not for strangers with you.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> Let your spring be blessed.<br/>

<span class="indented">Be captivated always with her love.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> For why should you, my son, be captivated with an adulteress?<br/>

<sup>21</sup> For the ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">He examines all his paths.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare him.<br/>

<h4>Sirach 9</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Don’t be jealous over the wife of your bosom,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t teach her an evil lesson against yourself.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Don’t give your soul to a woman,<br/>
<span class="indented">that she should set herself over your strength.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Don’t go to meet a woman who plays the prostitute,<br/>
<span class="indented">lest perhaps you fall into her snares.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Don’t associate with a woman singer,<br/>
<span class="indented">lest you be caught by her attempts.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Don’t gaze at a maid, lest you fall by those things<br/>
<span class="indented">that are precious in her.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Don’t give your soul to prostitutes,<br/>
<span class="indented">that you not lose your inheritance.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Don’t look around in the streets of the city,<br/>
<span class="indented">neither wander in its deserted places.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Turn your eye away from a beautiful woman,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t gaze at another’s beauty.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Many have been led astray by the beauty of a woman,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and with it passion is kindled like a fire.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Don’t sit at all with another man’s wife,<br/>
<span class="indented">or share the wine with her in revelry,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">lest your heart turn away from her,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and you go down in blood to the pit.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Don’t forsake an old friend,<br/>
<span class="indented">for the new is not comparable to him.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">A new friend is like new wine.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">If it becomes old, you will drink it with gladness.</span><br/>

<span class="indented">for you don’t know what his end will be.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Don’t delight in the delights of the ungodly.<br/>
<span class="indented">Remember they will not go unpunished to the grave.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Keep yourself far from the man who has power to kill,<br/>
<span class="indented">and you will have no suspicion of the fear of death.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">If you do come to him, commit no offense,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">lest he take away your life.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Know that you go among snares,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and walk upon the battlements of the city.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> As much as possible, inquire of your neighbor,<br/>
<span class="indented">and consult with the wise.</span><br/>

<span class="indented">Let your glory be in the fear of the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> A work will be commended for the skill of the craftsman;<br/>
<span class="indented">so he who rules the people will be considered wise for his speech.</span><br/>

<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 28</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> To you, Lord, I call.<br/>
<span class="indented">My rock, don’t be deaf to me,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">lest, if you are silent to me,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I would become like those who go down into the pit.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Hear the voice of my petitions when I cry to you,<br/>
<span class="indented">when I lift up my hands toward your Most Holy Place.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Don’t draw me away with the wicked,<br/>
<span class="indented">with the workers of iniquity who speak peace with their neighbors,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">but mischief is in their hearts.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Give them according to their work,<br/>
<span class="indented">and according to the wickedness of their doings.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Give them according to the operation of their hands.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Bring back on them what they deserve.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Because they don’t respect the works of the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor the operation of his hands,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">he will break them down and not build them up.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Blessed be the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">because he has heard the voice of my petitions.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> The Lord is my strength and my shield.<br/>
<span class="indented">My heart has trusted in him, and I am helped.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Therefore my heart greatly rejoices.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">With my song I will thank him.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> The Lord is their strength.<br/>
<span class="indented">He is a stronghold of salvation to his anointed.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Save your people, and bless your inheritance.<br/>
<span class="indented">Be their shepherd also, and bear them up forever.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 29</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Ascribe to the Lord, you sons of the mighty,<br/>
<span class="indented">ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Ascribe to the Lord the glory due to his name.<br/>
<span class="indented">Worship the Lord in holy array.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> The Lord’s voice is on the waters.<br/>
<span class="indented">The God of glory thunders, even the Lord on many waters.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> The Lord’s voice is powerful.<br/>
<span class="indented">The Lord’s voice is full of majesty.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> The Lord’s voice breaks the cedars.<br/>
<span class="indented">Yes, the Lord breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> He makes them also to skip like a calf;<br/>
<span class="indented">Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild ox.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> The Lord’s voice strikes with flashes of lightning.<br/>
<sup>8</sup> The Lord’s voice shakes the wilderness.<br/>
<span class="indented">The Lord shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> The Lord’s voice makes the deer calve,<br/>
<span class="indented">and strips the forests bare.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">In his temple everything says, “Glory!”</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> The Lord sat enthroned at the Flood.<br/>
<span class="indented">Yes, the Lord sits as King forever.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> The Lord will give strength to his people.<br/>
<span class="indented">The Lord will bless his people with peace.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 30</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> I will extol you, Lord, for you have raised me up,<br/>
<span class="indented">and have not made my foes to rejoice over me.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Lord my God, I cried to you, and you have healed me.<br/>
<sup>3</sup> Lord, you have brought up my soul from Sheol.<br/>
<span class="indented">You have kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Sing praise to the Lord, you saints of his.<br/>
<span class="indented">Give thanks to his holy name.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> For his anger is but for a moment.<br/>
<span class="indented">His favor is for a lifetime.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Weeping may stay for the night,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">but joy comes in the morning.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> As for me, I said in my prosperity, “I shall never be moved.”<br/>
<sup>7</sup> You, Lord, when you favored me, made my mountain stand strong;<br/>
<span class="indented">but when you hid your face, I was troubled.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> I cried to you, Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">I made supplication to the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> “What profit is there in my destruction, if I go down to the pit?<br/>
<span class="indented">Shall the dust praise you?</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Shall it declare your truth?</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Hear, Lord, and have mercy on me.<br/>
<span class="indented">Lord, be my helper.”</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> You have turned my mourning into dancing for me.<br/>
<span class="indented">You have removed my sackcloth, and clothed me with gladness,</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> to the end that my heart may sing praise to you, and not be silent.<br/>
<span class="indented">Lord my God, I will give thanks to you forever!</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 31</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> In you, Lord, I take refuge.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let me never be disappointed.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Deliver me in your righteousness.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Bow down your ear to me.<br/>
<span class="indented">Deliver me speedily.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Be to me a strong rock,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">a house of defense to save me.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> For you are my rock and my fortress,<br/>
<span class="indented">therefore for your name’s sake lead me and guide me.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Pluck me out of the net that they have laid secretly for me,<br/>
<span class="indented">for you are my stronghold.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Into your hand I commend my spirit.<br/>
<span class="indented">You redeem me, Lord, God of truth.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> I hate those who regard lying vanities,<br/>
<span class="indented">but I trust in the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> I will be glad and rejoice in your loving kindness,<br/>
<span class="indented">for you have seen my affliction.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">You have known my soul in adversities.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> You have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy.<br/>
<span class="indented">You have set my feet in a large room.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Have mercy on me, Lord, for I am in distress.<br/>
<span class="indented">My eye, my soul, and my body waste away with grief.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> For my life is spent with sorrow,<br/>
<span class="indented">my years with sighing.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">My strength fails because of my iniquity.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">My bones are wasted away.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Because of all my adversaries I have become utterly contemptible to my neighbors,<br/>
<span class="indented">a horror to my acquaintances.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Those who saw me on the street fled from me.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> I am forgotten from their hearts like a dead man.<br/>
<span class="indented">I am like broken pottery.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> For I have heard the slander of many, terror on every side,<br/>
<span class="indented">while they conspire together against me,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">they plot to take away my life.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> But I trust in you, Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">I said, “You are my God.”</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> My times are in your hand.<br/>
<span class="indented">Deliver me from the hand of my enemies and from those who persecute me.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Make your face to shine on your servant.<br/>
<span class="indented">Save me in your loving kindness.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Let me not be disappointed, Lord, for I have called on you.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let the wicked be disappointed.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Let them be silent in Sheol.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> Let the lying lips be mute,<br/>
<span class="indented">which speak against the righteous insolently, with pride and contempt.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> Oh how great is your goodness,<br/>
<span class="indented">which you have laid up for those who fear you,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">which you have worked for those who take refuge in you,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">before the sons of men!</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> In the shelter of your presence you will hide them from the plotting of man.<br/>
<span class="indented">You will keep them secretly in a dwelling away from the strife of tongues.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> Praise be to the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">for he has shown me his marvelous loving kindness in a strong city.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> As for me, I said in my haste, “I am cut off from before your eyes.”<br/>
<span class="indented">Nevertheless, you heard the voice of my petitions when I cried to you.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Oh love the Lord, all you his saints!<br/>
<span class="indented">The Lord preserves the faithful,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and fully recompenses him who behaves arrogantly.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> Be strong, and let your heart take courage,<br/>
<span class="indented">all you who hope in the Lord.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 6:1–19 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 6:1–19</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> My son, if you have become collateral for your neighbor,<br/>
<span class="indented">if you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger,</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> you are trapped by the words of your mouth;<br/>
<span class="indented">you are ensnared with the words of your mouth.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself,<br/>
<span class="indented">since you have come into the hand of your neighbor.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Go, humble yourself.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Press your plea with your neighbor.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Give no sleep to your eyes,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor slumber to your eyelids.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter,<br/>
<span class="indented">like a bird from the snare of the fowler.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Go to the ant, you sluggard.<br/>
<span class="indented">Consider her ways, and be wise;</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> which has no chief, overseer, or ruler,<br/>
<sup>8</sup> provides her bread in the summer,<br/>
<span class="indented">and gathers her food in the harvest.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> How long will you sleep, sluggard?<br/>
<span class="indented">When will you arise out of your sleep?</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> A little sleep, a little slumber,<br/>
<span class="indented">a little folding of the hands to sleep—</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> so your poverty will come as a robber,<br/>
<span class="indented">and your scarcity as an armed man.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> A worthless person, a man of iniquity,<br/>
<span class="indented">is he who walks with a perverse mouth,</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet,<br/>
<span class="indented">who motions with his fingers,</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> in whose heart is perverseness,<br/>
<span class="indented">who devises evil continually,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">who always sows discord.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Therefore his calamity will come suddenly.<br/>
<span class="indented">He will be broken suddenly, and that without remedy.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> There are six things which the Lord hates;<br/>
<span class="indented">yes, seven which are an abomination to him:</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> arrogant eyes, a lying tongue,<br/>
<span class="indented">hands that shed innocent blood,</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> a heart that devises wicked schemes,<br/>
<span class="indented">feet that are swift in running to mischief,</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> a false witness who utters lies,<br/>
<span class="indented">and he who sows discord among brothers.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 10 -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 10</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> A wise judge will instruct his people;<br/>
<span class="indented">and the government of a prudent man is well ordered.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> As the judge of the people is himself, so are his officers;<br/>
<span class="indented">and what manner of man the ruler of a city is, such are all those who dwell in it.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> An unwise king destroys his people;<br/>
<span class="indented">but through the understanding of those in authority the city will be inhabited.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> The power of the earth is in the hand of the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">and in due time he will set over it one who is profitable.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> In the hand of the Lord is the prosperity of man;<br/>
<span class="indented">and upon the person of the scribe he will lay his honor.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Don’t be angry with your neighbor for every wrong,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t do anything by works of violence.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Pride is hateful before God and man;<br/>
<span class="indented">and injustice is abhorrent to both.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Sovereignty is transferred from one people to another,<br/>
<span class="indented">because of injustices, covetous deeds, and deceit of money.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Why are dust and ashes proud?<br/>
<span class="indented">There is not a more wicked thing than to love money;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for the same man sets even his own soul for sale.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Because while he lives, he casts away his inner parts.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> All power is of short life.<br/>
<span class="indented">A long sickness wears even the physician out.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> A physician cuts off a long disease;<br/>
<span class="indented">and he who is king today will die tomorrow.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> For when a man is dead,<br/>
<span class="indented">he will inherit creeping things, wild beasts, and worms.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> The beginning of pride is to depart from the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">and arrogance is to turn away from the Almighty.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> For because of pride comes rebellion;<br/>
<span class="indented">he who holds to it will pour out abominations.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Therefore the Lord has brought upon them strange calamities,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and destroyed them utterly.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> The Lord has cast down the thrones of rulers,<br/>
<span class="indented">and has seated the meek in their place.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> The Lord has plucked up the roots of nations,<br/>
<span class="indented">and planted the humble in their place.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> The Lord has overthrown the lands of nations,<br/>
<span class="indented">and destroyed them to the foundations of the earth.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> He has removed some of them, and destroyed them,<br/>
<span class="indented">and has made their memory to cease from the earth.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> Pride was not created for men,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor wrathful anger for the offspring of women.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> Which race is worthy of honor? The race of man.<br/>
<span class="indented">Which race is worthy of honor? Those who fear the Lord.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Which race is unworthy of honor? The race of man.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Which race is unworthy of honor? Those who transgress the commandments.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> In the midst of brothers their leader is honorable;<br/>
<span class="indented">so are those who fear the Lord in his eyes.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> The rich, the honorable, and the poor<br/>
<span class="indented">all glory in the fear of the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> It is not right to despise a poor man who has understanding;<br/>
<span class="indented">and it is not fitting to glorify a man who is a sinner.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> The great man, the judge, and the mighty man will be glorified;<br/>
<span class="indented">and there is not one of them greater than he who fears the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> Free men will serve a wise servant,<br/>
<span class="indented">and a man of understanding will not complain.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> Don’t make a display of your wisdom when you do your work,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t glorify yourself in the time of your distress.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> Better is he who labors and abounds in all things,<br/>
<span class="indented">than he who glorifies himself and lacks bread.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> My son, glorify your soul in humility,<br/>
<span class="indented">and give it honor according to its worth.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> Who will justify him who sins against his own soul?<br/>
<span class="indented">Who will honor him who dishonors his own life?</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> A poor man is honored for his knowledge,<br/>
<span class="indented">while a rich man is honored for his wealth.</span><br/>
<sup>31</sup> But he who is honored in poverty, how much more in wealth?<br/>
<span class="indented">And he who is dishonored in wealth, how much more in poverty?</span> </p></section>

<h2>Day 11</h2>
<!-- Psalms 32, 33, 34 -->
<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 32</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Blessed is he whose disobedience is forgiven,<br/>
<span class="indented">whose sin is covered.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Blessed is the man to whom the Lord doesn’t impute iniquity,<br/>
<span class="indented">in whose spirit there is no deceit.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> When I kept silence, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.<br/>
<sup>4</sup> For day and night your hand was heavy on me.<br/>
<span class="indented">My strength was sapped in the heat of summer.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> I acknowledged my sin to you.<br/>
<span class="indented">I didn’t hide my iniquity.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I said, “I will confess my transgressions to the Lord,”</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and you forgave the iniquity of my sin.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> For this, let everyone who is godly pray to you in a time when you may be found.<br/>
<span class="indented">Surely when the great waters overflow, they shall not reach to him.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> You are my hiding place.<br/>
<span class="indented">You will preserve me from trouble.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">You will surround me with songs of deliverance.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you shall go.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will counsel you with my eye on you.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Don’t be like the horse, or like the mule, which have no understanding,<br/>
<span class="indented">who are controlled by bit and bridle, or else they will not come near to you.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Many sorrows come to the wicked,<br/>
<span class="indented">but loving kindness shall surround him who trusts in the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, you righteous!<br/>
<span class="indented">Shout for joy, all you who are upright in heart!</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 33</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Rejoice in the Lord, you righteous!<br/>
<span class="indented">Praise is fitting for the upright.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Give thanks to the Lord with the lyre.<br/>
<span class="indented">Sing praises to him with the harp of ten strings.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Sing to him a new song.<br/>
<span class="indented">Play skillfully with a shout of joy.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> For the Lord’s word is right.<br/>
<span class="indented">All his work is done in faithfulness.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> He loves righteousness and justice.<br/>
<span class="indented">The earth is full of the loving kindness of the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> By the Lord’s word, the heavens were made:<br/>
<span class="indented">all their army by the breath of his mouth.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap.<br/>
<span class="indented">He lays up the deeps in storehouses.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Let all the earth fear the Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> For he spoke, and it was done.<br/>
<span class="indented">He commanded, and it stood firm.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> The Lord brings the counsel of the nations to nothing.<br/>
<span class="indented">He makes the thoughts of the peoples to be of no effect.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> The counsel of the Lord stands fast forever,<br/>
<span class="indented">the thoughts of his heart to all generations.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">the people whom he has chosen for his own inheritance.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> The Lord looks from heaven.<br/>
<span class="indented">He sees all the sons of men.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> From the place of his habitation he looks out on all the inhabitants of the earth—<br/>
<sup>15</sup> he who fashions all of their hearts;<br/>
<span class="indented">and he considers all of their works.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> There is no king saved by the multitude of an army.<br/>
<span class="indented">A mighty man is not delivered by great strength.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> A horse is a vain thing for safety,<br/>
<span class="indented">neither does he deliver any by his great power.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> Behold, the Lord’s eye is on those who fear him,<br/>
<span class="indented">on those who hope in his loving kindness;</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> to deliver their soul from death,<br/>
<span class="indented">to keep them alive in famine.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> Our soul has waited for the Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">He is our help and our shield.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> For our heart rejoices in him,<br/>
<span class="indented">because we have trusted in his holy name.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> Let your loving kindness be on us, Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">since we have hoped in you.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 34</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> I will bless the Lord at all times.<br/>
<span class="indented">His praise will always be in my mouth.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> My soul shall boast in the Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">The humble shall hear of it and be glad.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Oh magnify the Lord with me.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let’s exalt his name together.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> I sought the Lord, and he answered me,<br/>
<span class="indented">and delivered me from all my fears.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> They looked to him, and were radiant.<br/>
<span class="indented">Their faces shall never be covered with shame.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him,<br/>
<span class="indented">and saved him out of all his troubles.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> The Lord’s angel encamps around those who fear him,<br/>
<span class="indented">and delivers them.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Oh taste and see that the Lord is good.<br/>
<span class="indented">Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Oh fear the Lord, you his saints,<br/>
<span class="indented">for there is no lack with those who fear him.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger,<br/>
<span class="indented">but those who seek the Lord shall not lack any good thing.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Come, you children, listen to me.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will teach you the fear of the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Who is someone who desires life,<br/>
<span class="indented">and loves many days, that he may see good?</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Keep your tongue from evil,<br/>
<span class="indented">and your lips from speaking lies.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Depart from evil, and do good.<br/>
<span class="indented">Seek peace, and pursue it.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> The Lord’s eyes are toward the righteous.<br/>
<span class="indented">His ears listen to their cry.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> The Lord’s face is against those who do evil,<br/>
<span class="indented">to cut off the memory of them from the earth.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> The righteous cry, and the Lord hears,<br/>
<span class="indented">and delivers them out of all their troubles.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> The Lord is near to those who have a broken heart,<br/>
<span class="indented">and saves those who have a crushed spirit.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> Many are the afflictions of the righteous,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the Lord delivers him out of them all.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> He protects all of his bones.<br/>
<span class="indented">Not one of them is broken.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> Evil shall kill the wicked.<br/>
<span class="indented">Those who hate the righteous shall be condemned.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> The Lord redeems the soul of his servants.<br/>
<span class="indented">None of those who take refuge in him shall be condemned.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 6:20–35 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 6:20–35</h4>
<p>
<sup>20</sup> My son, keep your father’s commandment,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> Bind them continually on your heart.<br/>
<span class="indented">Tie them around your neck.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> When you walk, it will lead you.<br/>
<span class="indented">When you sleep, it will watch over you.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">When you awake, it will talk with you.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> For the commandment is a lamp,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the law is light.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Reproofs of instruction are the way of life,</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> to keep you from the immoral woman,<br/>
<span class="indented">from the flattery of the wayward wife’s tongue.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> Don’t lust after her beauty in your heart,<br/>
<span class="indented">neither let her captivate you with her eyelids.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> For a prostitute reduces you to a piece of bread.<br/>
<span class="indented">The adulteress hunts for your precious life.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> Can a man scoop fire into his lap,<br/>
<span class="indented">and his clothes not be burned?</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> Or can one walk on hot coals,<br/>
<span class="indented">and his feet not be scorched?</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> So is he who goes in to his neighbor’s wife.<br/>
<span class="indented">Whoever touches her will not be unpunished.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> Men don’t despise a thief if he steals<br/>
<span class="indented">to satisfy himself when he is hungry;</span><br/>
<sup>31</sup> but if he is found, he shall restore seven times.<br/>
<span class="indented">He shall give all the wealth of his house.</span><br/>
<sup>32</sup> He who commits adultery with a woman is void of understanding.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who does it destroys his own soul.</span><br/>
<sup>33</sup> He will get wounds and dishonor.<br/>
<span class="indented">His reproach will not be wiped away.</span><br/>
<sup>34</sup> For jealousy arouses the fury of the husband.<br/>
<span class="indented">He won’t spare in the day of vengeance.</span><br/>
<sup>35</sup> He won’t regard any ransom,<br/>
<span class="indented">neither will he rest content, though you give many gifts.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 11 -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 11</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> The wisdom of the humble lifts their heads high,<br/>
<span class="indented">and makes them sit among the great.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Don’t praise a man for his good looks,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t detest a man for his outward appearance.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> The bee is small among flying creatures,<br/>
<span class="indented">but her fruit is the chief of sweet things.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Don’t boast about your clothing and don’t exalt yourself<br/>
<span class="indented">in the day of honor,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for the works of the Lord are wonderful,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and his works are hidden among men.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Many kings have sat down upon the ground,<br/>
<span class="indented">but one who was never thought of has worn a crown.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Many mighty men have been greatly disgraced,<br/>
<span class="indented">and illustrious men have been delivered into other men’s hands.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Don’t blame before you investigate.<br/>
<span class="indented">Understand first, and then rebuke.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Don’t answer before you have heard.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t interrupt in the middle of speech.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Don’t strive in a matter that doesn’t concern you;<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t sit with sinners when they judge.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> My son, don’t get involved in many matters;<br/>
<span class="indented">for if you meddle much, you will not be unpunished;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and if you pursue, you will not overtake;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and you will not escape by fleeing.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> There is one who toils, labors, and hurries,<br/>
<span class="indented">and is so much the more behind.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Again, there is one who is slow,<br/>
<span class="indented">and needs help, lacking in strength,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">who abounds in poverty;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">but the Lord’s eyes looked upon him for good;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">he set him up from his low estate,</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> and lifted up his head;<br/>
<span class="indented">and many marveled at him.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Good things and bad, life and death,<br/>
<span class="indented">poverty and riches, are from the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Wisdom, knowledge, and understanding of the law<br/>
<span class="indented">come from the Lord;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">love and the way of good works come from him.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Error and darkness were formed with sinners from the beginning;<br/>
<span class="indented">and evil grows old with those who take pride in it.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> The Lord’s gift remains with the godly,<br/>
<span class="indented">and his favor brings prosperity forever.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> There is one who grows rich by his wariness and pinching,<br/>
<span class="indented">and this is the portion of his reward:</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> when he says, “I have found rest,<br/>
<span class="indented">and now I will eat of my goods,”</span><br/>
<span class="indented">he doesn’t know how much time will pass</span><br/>
<span class="indented">until he leaves them to others and dies.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> Be steadfast in your covenant, and be doing it,<br/>
<span class="indented">and grow old in your work.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> Don’t marvel at the works of a sinner;<br/>
<span class="indented">but trust the Lord, and remain in your labor.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">For it is an easy thing in the sight of the Lord</span><br/>
<span class="indented">to suddenly make a poor man rich.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> The blessing of the Lord is in the reward of the godly.<br/>
<span class="indented">Suddenly he makes his blessing flourish.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Don’t say, “What use is there of me?<br/>
<span class="indented">What further good things can I do?”</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> Don’t say, “I have enough.<br/>
<span class="indented">What harm could happen to me now?”</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> In the day of prosperity, there is a forgetfulness of affliction;<br/>
<span class="indented">and in the day of affliction, there is no more remembrance of prosperity.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> For it is an easy thing in the sight of the Lord<br/>
<span class="indented">to reward a man on the day of death according to his ways.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> The affliction of an hour causes delights to forgetfulness;<br/>
<span class="indented">and a man’s deeds will be revealed at the last.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> Call no man happy before his death;<br/>
<span class="indented">a man will be known in his children.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> Don’t bring every man into your house;<br/>
<span class="indented">for deceitful men are many.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> Like as a decoy partridge in a cage, so is the heart of a proud man;<br/>
<span class="indented">and like a spy, he looks for your weakness.</span><br/>
<sup>31</sup> For he lies in wait to turn good into evil.<br/>
<span class="indented">He will lay blame on the chosen one.</span><br/>
<sup>32</sup> A spark of fire will burn many coals;<br/>
<span class="indented">and a sinner lies in wait for blood.</span><br/>
<sup>33</sup> Take heed of an evildoer, for he contrives wicked things;<br/>
<span class="indented">lest he bring on you a perpetual blame.</span><br/>
<sup>34</sup> Receive a stranger into your house, and he will distract you with brawls,<br/>
<span class="indented">and estrange you from your own.</span> </p></section>

<!-- Psalms 35, 36 -->
<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 35</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Contend, Lord, with those who contend with me.<br/>
<span class="indented">Fight against those who fight against me.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Take hold of shield and buckler,<br/>
<span class="indented">and stand up for my help.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Brandish the spear and block those who pursue me.<br/>
<span class="indented">Tell my soul, “I am your salvation.”</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Let those who seek after my soul be disappointed and brought to dishonor.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let those who plot my ruin be turned back and confounded.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Let them be as chaff before the wind,<br/>
<span class="indented">the Lord’s angel driving them on.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Let their way be dark and slippery,<br/>
<span class="indented">the Lord’s angel pursuing them.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> For without cause they have hidden their net in a pit for me.<br/>
<span class="indented">Without cause they have dug a pit for my soul.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Let destruction come on him unawares.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let his net that he has hidden catch himself.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Let him fall into that destruction.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> My soul shall be joyful in the Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">It shall rejoice in his salvation.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> All my bones shall say, “Lord, who is like you,<br/>
<span class="indented">who delivers the poor from him who is too strong for him;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">yes, the poor and the needy from him who robs him?”</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Unrighteous witnesses rise up.<br/>
<span class="indented">They ask me about things that I don’t know about.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> They reward me evil for good,<br/>
<span class="indented">to the bereaving of my soul.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth.<br/>
<span class="indented">I afflicted my soul with fasting.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">My prayer returned into my own bosom.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother.<br/>
<span class="indented">I bowed down mourning, as one who mourns his mother.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> But in my adversity, they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together.<br/>
<span class="indented">The attackers gathered themselves together against me, and I didn’t know it.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">They tore at me and didn’t cease.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Like the profane mockers in feasts,<br/>
<span class="indented">they gnashed their teeth at me.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Lord, how long will you look on?<br/>
<span class="indented">Rescue my soul from their destruction,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">my precious life from the lions.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> I will give you thanks in the great assembly.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will praise you among many people.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> Don’t let those who are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me;<br/>
<span class="indented">neither let those who hate me without a cause wink their eyes.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> For they don’t speak peace,<br/>
<span class="indented">but they devise deceitful words against those who are quiet in the land.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> Yes, they opened their mouth wide against me.<br/>
<span class="indented">They said, “Aha! Aha! Our eye has seen it!”</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> You have seen it, Lord. Don’t keep silent.<br/>
<span class="indented">Lord, don’t be far from me.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Wake up! Rise up to defend me, my God!<br/>
<span class="indented">My Lord, contend for me!</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> Vindicate me, Lord my God, according to your righteousness.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t let them gloat over me.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> Don’t let them say in their heart, “Aha! That’s the way we want it!”<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t let them say, “We have swallowed him up!”</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> Let them be disappointed and confounded together who rejoice at my calamity.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let them be clothed with shame and dishonor who magnify themselves against me.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> Let those who delight in my vindication shout for joy and be glad.<br/>
<span class="indented">Yes, let them say continually, “May the Lord be exalted,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">who delights in the peace of his servant!”</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> My tongue shall talk about your righteousness and about your praise all day long.
  </p>
<h4>Psalm 36</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> A revelation is within my heart about the disobedience of the wicked:<br/>
<span class="indented">“There is no fear of God before his eyes.”</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> For he flatters himself in his own eyes,<br/>
<span class="indented">too much to detect and hate his sin.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit.<br/>
<span class="indented">He has ceased to be wise and to do good.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> He plots iniquity on his bed.<br/>
<span class="indented">He sets himself in a way that is not good.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He doesn’t abhor evil.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Your loving kindness, Lord, is in the heavens.<br/>
<span class="indented">Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Your righteousness is like the mountains of God.<br/>
<span class="indented">Your judgments are like a great deep.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Lord, you preserve man and animal.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> How precious is your loving kindness, God!<br/>
<span class="indented">The children of men take refuge under the shadow of your wings.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> They shall be abundantly satisfied with the abundance of your house.<br/>
<span class="indented">You will make them drink of the river of your pleasures.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> For with you is the spring of life.<br/>
<span class="indented">In your light we will see light.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Oh continue your loving kindness to those who know you,<br/>
<span class="indented">your righteousness to the upright in heart.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Don’t let the foot of pride come against me.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t let the hand of the wicked drive me away.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> There the workers of iniquity are fallen.<br/>
<span class="indented">They are thrust down, and shall not be able to rise.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 7:1–5 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 7:1–5</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> My son, keep my words.<br/>
<span class="indented">Lay up my commandments within you.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Keep my commandments and live!<br/>
<span class="indented">Guard my teaching as the apple of your eye.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Bind them on your fingers.<br/>
<span class="indented">Write them on the tablet of your heart.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Tell wisdom, “You are my sister.”<br/>
<span class="indented">Call understanding your relative,</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> that they may keep you from the strange woman,<br/>
<span class="indented">from the foreigner who flatters with her words.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 12 -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 12</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> If you do good, know to whom you do it;<br/>
<span class="indented">so you will be thanked for your good deeds.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Do good to a godly man, and you will be repaid—<br/>
<span class="indented">if not by him, yet by the Most High.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> There can’t no good come to him who continues to do evil,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor to him who doesn’t give alms.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Give to the godly man,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t help the sinner.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Do good to one who is lowly,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t give to an ungodly man.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Keep back his bread, and don’t give it to him,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">lest he overmaster you by it;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for you would receive twice as much evil</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for all the good you would have done to him.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> For the Most High also hates sinners,<br/>
<span class="indented">and will repay vengeance to the ungodly.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Give to the good man, and don’t help the sinner.<br/>
<sup>8</sup> A friend won’t be known in prosperity.<br/>
<span class="indented">An enemy won’t be hidden in adversity.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> In a man’s prosperity his enemies are grieved,<br/>
<span class="indented">but in his adversity his friend is revealed.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Never trust your enemy,<br/>
<span class="indented">for his wickedness is like rust and brass.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Even if he humbles himself, and goes crouching,<br/>
<span class="indented">be on your guard, and keep yourself from him.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">You will be to him like one who has polished a mirror,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and you will know that his rust has not been altogether wiped away.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Don’t set him by you,<br/>
<span class="indented">lest he overthrow you and stand in your place.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t let him sit on your right hand,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">lest he seek your seat,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and you at the last remember my words,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and be pricked by my words.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Who will pity a charmer that is bitten by a serpent,<br/>
<span class="indented">or any who come near wild beasts?</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> So is he who goes to a sinner,<br/>
<span class="indented">and is defiled with him in his sins.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> He will stay with you for a while,<br/>
<span class="indented">but if you falter, he won’t stay.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> The enemy will speak sweetly with his lips,<br/>
<span class="indented">and plan to throw you into a pit.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">The enemy will weep with his eyes,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">but if he finds an opportunity, he will not be satisfied with blood.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> If adversity comes on you, you will find him there before you.<br/>
<span class="indented">Pretending to help you, he will trip you by the heel.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> He will shake his head, clap his hands,<br/>
<span class="indented">whisper much, and change his expression.</span> </p></section>

<h2>Day 13</h2>
<!-- Psalms 37 -->
<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 37</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Don’t fret because of evildoers,<br/>
<span class="indented">neither be envious against those who work unrighteousness.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> For they shall soon be cut down like the grass,<br/>
<span class="indented">and wither like the green herb.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Trust in the Lord, and do good.<br/>
<span class="indented">Dwell in the land, and enjoy safe pasture.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Also delight yourself in the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">and he will give you the desires of your heart.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Commit your way to the Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">Trust also in him, and he will do this:</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> he will make your righteousness shine out like light,<br/>
<span class="indented">and your justice as the noon day sun.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t fret because of him who prospers in his way,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">because of the man who makes wicked plots happen.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Cease from anger, and forsake wrath.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t fret; it leads only to evildoing.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> For evildoers shall be cut off,<br/>
<span class="indented">but those who wait for the Lord shall inherit the land.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> For yet a little while, and the wicked will be no more.<br/>
<span class="indented">Yes, though you look for his place, he isn’t there.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> But the humble shall inherit the land,<br/>
<span class="indented">and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> The wicked plots against the just,<br/>
<span class="indented">and gnashes at him with his teeth.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> The Lord will laugh at him,<br/>
<span class="indented">for he sees that his day is coming.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow,<br/>
<span class="indented">to cast down the poor and needy,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">to kill those who are upright on the path.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Their sword shall enter into their own heart.<br/>
<span class="indented">Their bows shall be broken.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Better is a little that the righteous has,<br/>
<span class="indented">than the abundance of many wicked.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> For the arms of the wicked shall be broken,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the Lord upholds the righteous.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> The Lord knows the days of the perfect.<br/>
<span class="indented">Their inheritance shall be forever.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> They shall not be disappointed in the time of evil.<br/>
<span class="indented">In the days of famine they shall be satisfied.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> But the wicked shall perish.<br/>
<span class="indented">The enemies of the Lord shall be like the beauty of the fields.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">They will vanish—vanish like smoke.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> The wicked borrow, and don’t pay back,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the righteous give generously.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> For such as are blessed by him shall inherit the land.<br/>
<span class="indented">Those who are cursed by him shall be cut off.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> A man’s steps are established by the Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">He delights in his way.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> Though he stumble, he shall not fall,<br/>
<span class="indented">for the Lord holds him up with his hand.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> I have been young, and now am old,<br/>
<span class="indented">yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">nor his children begging for bread.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> All day long he deals graciously, and lends.<br/>
<span class="indented">His offspring is blessed.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> Depart from evil, and do good.<br/>
<span class="indented">Live securely forever.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> For the Lord loves justice,<br/>
<span class="indented">and doesn’t forsake his saints.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">They are preserved forever,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">but the children of the wicked shall be cut off.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> The righteous shall inherit the land,<br/>
<span class="indented">and live in it forever.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> The mouth of the righteous talks of wisdom.<br/>
<span class="indented">His tongue speaks justice.</span><br/>
<sup>31</sup> The law of his God is in his heart.<br/>
<span class="indented">None of his steps shall slide.</span><br/>
<sup>32</sup> The wicked watch the righteous,<br/>
<span class="indented">and seek to kill him.</span><br/>
<sup>33</sup> The Lord will not leave him in his hand,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor condemn him when he is judged.</span><br/>
<sup>34</sup> Wait for the Lord, and keep his way,<br/>
<span class="indented">and he will exalt you to inherit the land.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">When the wicked are cut off, you shall see it.</span><br/>
<sup>35</sup> I have seen the wicked in great power,<br/>
<span class="indented">spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil.</span><br/>
<sup>36</sup> But he passed away, and behold, he was not.<br/>
<span class="indented">Yes, I sought him, but he could not be found.</span><br/>
<sup>37</sup> Mark the perfect man, and see the upright,<br/>
<span class="indented">for there is a future for the man of peace.</span><br/>
<sup>38</sup> As for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together.<br/>
<span class="indented">The future of the wicked shall be cut off.</span><br/>
<sup>39</sup> But the salvation of the righteous is from the Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">He is their stronghold in the time of trouble.</span><br/>
<sup>40</sup> The Lord helps them, and rescues them.<br/>
<span class="indented">He rescues them from the wicked, and saves them,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">because they have taken refuge in him.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 7:6–27 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 7:6–27</h4>
<p>
<sup>6</sup> For at the window of my house,<br/>
<span class="indented">I looked out through my lattice.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> I saw among the simple ones.<br/>
<span class="indented">I discerned among the youths a young man void of understanding,</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> passing through the street near her corner,<br/>
<span class="indented">he went the way to her house,</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> in the twilight, in the evening of the day,<br/>
<span class="indented">in the middle of the night and in the darkness.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Behold, there a woman met him with the attire of a prostitute,<br/>
<span class="indented">and with crafty intent.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> She is loud and defiant.<br/>
<span class="indented">Her feet don’t stay in her house.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Now she is in the streets, now in the squares,<br/>
<span class="indented">and lurking at every corner.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> So she caught him, and kissed him.<br/>
<span class="indented">With an impudent face she said to him:</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> “Sacrifices of peace offerings are with me.<br/>
<span class="indented">Today I have paid my vows.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Therefore I came out to meet you,<br/>
<span class="indented">to diligently seek your face,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and I have found you.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry,<br/>
<span class="indented">with striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.<br/>
<sup>18</sup> Come, let’s take our fill of loving until the morning.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let’s solace ourselves with loving.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> For my husband isn’t at home.<br/>
<span class="indented">He has gone on a long journey.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> He has taken a bag of money with him.<br/>
<span class="indented">He will come home at the full moon.”</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> With persuasive words, she led him astray.<br/>
<span class="indented">With the flattering of her lips, she seduced him.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> He followed her immediately,<br/>
<span class="indented">as an ox goes to the slaughter,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">as a fool stepping into a noose.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Until an arrow strikes through his liver,<br/>
<span class="indented">as a bird hurries to the snare,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and doesn’t know that it will cost his life.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> Now therefore, sons, listen to me.<br/>
<span class="indented">Pay attention to the words of my mouth.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> Don’t let your heart turn to her ways.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t go astray in her paths,</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> for she has thrown down many wounded.<br/>
<span class="indented">Yes, all her slain are a mighty army.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> Her house is the way to Sheol,<br/>
<span class="indented">going down to the rooms of death.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 13 -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 13</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> He who touches pitch will be defiled.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who associates with a proud man will become like him.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Don’t carry a burden too heavy for you.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t associate yourself with one who is mightier and richer than you.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">What fellowship would the earthen pot have with the kettle?</span><br/>
<span class="indented">The kettle will strike, and the pot will be broken.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> The rich man does a wrong, and he threatens.<br/>
<span class="indented">The poor is wronged, and he must beg.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> If you are profitable, he will make merchandise of you.<br/>
<span class="indented">If you are in want, he will forsake you.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> If you own something, he will live with you.<br/>
<span class="indented">He will drain your resources, and he won’t feel sorry for you.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> When he needs you, he will deceive you.<br/>
<span class="indented">He will smile at you and give you hope.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He will speak kindly to you and say, “What do you need?”</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> He will shame you by his feasts,<br/>
<span class="indented">until he has made you bare two or three times.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Afterward, he will mock you.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Finally, when he sees you, he will forsake you</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and shake his head at you.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Beware that you are not deceived,<br/>
<span class="indented">and brought down in your enjoyment.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> If you are invited by a mighty man,<br/>
<span class="indented">withdraw yourself.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Then he will invite you all the more.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Don’t press yourself on him, lest you be thrust away;<br/>
<span class="indented">but don’t stand far off, lest you be forgotten.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Don’t intend to speak with him as an equal,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t trust his many words;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for he will test you with much talk,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and will examine you in a smiling way.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> He who doesn’t keep confidences to himself is unmerciful.<br/>
<span class="indented">He won’t spare you from harm, or from binding you as a prisoner.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Keep yourself far from the man who has power to kill,<br/>
<span class="indented">and you will have no suspicion of the fear of death.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">If you come to him, don’t commit any fault,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">lest he take away your life.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Know that you go about among snares,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and that you walk on the battlements of the city.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> As much as possible, get to know your neighbors,<br/>
<span class="indented">and consult with the wise.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Let your conversation be with men of understanding,<br/>
<span class="indented">and let all your discourse be about the law of the Most High.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Let righteous men be companions at your table.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let your glory be in the fear of the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> A work is commended by its resources;<br/>
<span class="indented">so he who speaks wisely is wise to the ears of those who will listen.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> As a pale is set between two things, so is sin between selling and buying.<br/>
<sup>19</sup> Unless a man holds diligently to the fear of the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">his house will soon be overthrown.</span> </p></section>

<h2>Day 14</h2>
<!-- Psalms 38, 39 -->
<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 38</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Lord, don’t rebuke me in your wrath,<br/>
<span class="indented">neither chasten me in your hot displeasure.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> For your arrows have pierced me,<br/>
<span class="indented">your hand presses hard on me.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation,<br/>
<span class="indented">neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> For my iniquities have gone over my head.<br/>
<span class="indented">As a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> My wounds are loathsome and corrupt<br/>
<span class="indented">because of my foolishness.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> I am in pain and bowed down greatly.<br/>
<span class="indented">I go mourning all day long.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> For my waist is filled with burning.<br/>
<span class="indented">There is no soundness in my flesh.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> I am faint and severely bruised.<br/>
<span class="indented">I have groaned by reason of the anguish of my heart.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Lord, all my desire is before you.<br/>
<span class="indented">My groaning is not hidden from you.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> My heart throbs.<br/>
<span class="indented">My strength fails me.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">As for the light of my eyes, it has also left me.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague.<br/>
<span class="indented">My kinsmen stand far away.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> They also who seek after my life lay snares.<br/>
<span class="indented">Those who seek my hurt speak mischievous things,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and meditate deceits all day long.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> But I, as a deaf man, don’t hear.<br/>
<span class="indented">I am as a mute man who doesn’t open his mouth.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Yes, I am as a man who doesn’t hear,<br/>
<span class="indented">in whose mouth are no reproofs.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> For I hope in you, Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">You will answer, Lord my God.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> For I said, “Don’t let them gloat over me,<br/>
<span class="indented">or exalt themselves over me when my foot slips.”</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> For I am ready to fall.<br/>
<span class="indented">My pain is continually before me.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> For I will declare my iniquity.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will be sorry for my sin.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> But my enemies are vigorous and many.<br/>
<span class="indented">Those who hate me without reason are numerous.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> They who also render evil for good are adversaries to me,<br/>
<span class="indented">because I follow what is good.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> Don’t forsake me, Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">My God, don’t be far from me.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> Hurry to help me,<br/>
<span class="indented">Lord, my salvation.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 39</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> I said, “I will watch my ways, so that I don’t sin with my tongue.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before me.”</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> I was mute with silence.<br/>
<span class="indented">I held my peace, even from good.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">My sorrow was stirred.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> My heart was hot within me.<br/>
<span class="indented">While I meditated, the fire burned.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I spoke with my tongue:</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> “Lord, show me my end,<br/>
<span class="indented">what is the measure of my days.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Let me know how frail I am.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Behold, you have made my days hand-widths.<br/>
<span class="indented">My lifetime is as nothing before you.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Surely every man stands as a breath.”</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> “Surely every man walks like a shadow.<br/>
<span class="indented">Surely they busy themselves in vain.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He heaps up, and doesn’t know who shall gather.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Now, Lord, what do I wait for?<br/>
<span class="indented">My hope is in you.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Deliver me from all my transgressions.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t make me the reproach of the foolish.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> I was mute.<br/>
<span class="indented">I didn’t open my mouth,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">because you did it.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Remove your scourge away from me.<br/>
<span class="indented">I am overcome by the blow of your hand.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> When you rebuke and correct man for iniquity,<br/>
<span class="indented">you consume his wealth like a moth.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Surely every man is but a breath.”</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> “Hear my prayer, Lord, and give ear to my cry.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t be silent at my tears.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">For I am a stranger with you,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">a foreigner, as all my fathers were.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Oh spare me, that I may recover strength,<br/>
<span class="indented">before I go away and exist no more.”</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 8:1–21 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 8:1–21</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Doesn’t wisdom cry out?<br/>
<span class="indented">Doesn’t understanding raise her voice?</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> On the top of high places by the way,<br/>
<span class="indented">where the paths meet, she stands.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Beside the gates, at the entry of the city,<br/>
<span class="indented">at the entry doors, she cries aloud:</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> “I call to you men!<br/>
<span class="indented">I send my voice to the sons of mankind.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> You simple, understand prudence!<br/>
<span class="indented">You fools, be of an understanding heart!</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Hear, for I will speak excellent things.<br/>
<span class="indented">The opening of my lips is for right things.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> For my mouth speaks truth.<br/>
<span class="indented">Wickedness is an abomination to my lips.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> All the words of my mouth are in righteousness.<br/>
<span class="indented">There is nothing crooked or perverse in them.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> They are all plain to him who understands,<br/>
<span class="indented">right to those who find knowledge.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Receive my instruction rather than silver;<br/>
<span class="indented">knowledge rather than choice gold.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> For wisdom is better than rubies.<br/>
<span class="indented">All the things that may be desired can’t be compared to it.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> “I, wisdom, have made prudence my dwelling.<br/>
<span class="indented">Find out knowledge and discretion.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> The fear of the Lord is to hate evil.<br/>
<span class="indented">I hate pride, arrogance, the evil way, and the perverse mouth.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Counsel and sound knowledge are mine.<br/>
<span class="indented">I have understanding and power.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> By me kings reign,<br/>
<span class="indented">and princes decree justice.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> By me princes rule,<br/>
<span class="indented">nobles, and all the righteous rulers of the earth.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> I love those who love me.<br/>
<span class="indented">Those who seek me diligently will find me.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> With me are riches, honor,<br/>
<span class="indented">enduring wealth, and prosperity.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> My fruit is better than gold, yes, than fine gold;<br/>
<span class="indented">my yield than choice silver.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> I walk in the way of righteousness,<br/>
<span class="indented">in the middle of the paths of justice,</span><br/>

<span class="indented">I fill their treasuries.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 14 -->

<h4>Sirach 14</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Blessed is the man who has not slipped with his mouth,<br/>
<span class="indented">and is not pricked with sorrow for sins.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Blessed is he whose soul does not condemn him,<br/>
<span class="indented">and who has not fallen from his hope.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Riches are not appropriate for a stingy man.<br/>
<span class="indented">Why should an envious man make use of money?</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> He who gathers by depriving himself gathers for others,<br/>
<span class="indented">who will revel in his goods.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> He who is evil to himself, to whom will he be good?<br/>
<span class="indented">He won’t enjoy what he obtains.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> There is none worse than he who is grudging to himself.<br/>
<span class="indented">This is the repayment of his wickedness.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Even if he does good, he does it in forgetfulness;<br/>
<span class="indented">and in the end he shows his wickedness.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> The envious man has a wicked eye.<br/>
<span class="indented">He turns away his face and despises men.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> A covetous man’s eye is not satisfied with his portion.<br/>
<span class="indented">Wicked injustice withers his soul.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> An evil eye is toward evil,<br/>
<span class="indented">and he will not be satisfied with bread,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">but will be needy and mourn at his own table.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> My son, according to what you have, do good to yourself,<br/>
<span class="indented">and bring worthy offerings to the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Remember that death will not wait.<br/>
<span class="indented">You haven’t been shown the covenant of Hades.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Do good to your friend before you die;<br/>
<span class="indented">and according to your ability, stretch out your hand and give to him.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Don’t defraud yourself of a good day.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t let your portion of a good desire pass you by.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Won’t you leave your labors to another,<br/>
<span class="indented">and your toils to be divided by lot?</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Give, take, and sanctify your soul,<br/>
<span class="indented">because there is no seeking of luxuries in the grave.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> All flesh grows old like a garment,<br/>
<span class="indented">for the covenant from the beginning is, “You shall die the death.”</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> Like the leaves flourishing on a thick tree,<br/>
<span class="indented">some it sheds and some it grows—</span><br/>
<span class="indented">so also is the generation of flesh and blood;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">one comes to an end, and another is born.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> Every work rots and falls away,<br/>
<span class="indented">and its worker will go with it.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> Blessed is the man who meditates on wisdom,<br/>
<span class="indented">and who reasons by his understanding.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> He who considers her ways in his heart<br/>
<span class="indented">will also have understanding in her secrets.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> Go after her like a tracker,<br/>
<span class="indented">and lie in wait in her ways.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> He who peers in at her windows<br/>

<sup>25</sup> He will pitch his tent near at hand to her,<br/>
<span class="indented">and will lodge in a lodging where good things are.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> He will set his children under her shelter,<br/>
<span class="indented">and will lodge under her branches.</span><br/>

<h2>Day 15</h2>
<!-- Psalms 40, 41, 42 -->
<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 40</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> I waited patiently for the Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">He turned to me, and heard my cry.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> He brought me up also out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay.<br/>
<span class="indented">He set my feet on a rock,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and gave me a firm place to stand.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> He has put a new song in my mouth, even praise to our God.<br/>
<span class="indented">Many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Blessed is the man who makes the Lord his trust,<br/>
<span class="indented">and doesn’t respect the proud,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">nor such as turn away to lies.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Many, Lord, my God, are the wonderful works which you have done,<br/>
<span class="indented">and your thoughts which are toward us.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">They can’t be declared back to you.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">If I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be counted.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Sacrifice and offering you didn’t desire.<br/>
<span class="indented">You have opened my ears.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">You have not required burnt offering and sin offering.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Then I said, “Behold, I have come.<br/>
<span class="indented">It is written about me in the book in the scroll.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> I delight to do your will, my God.<br/>
<span class="indented">Yes, your law is within my heart.”</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> I have proclaimed glad news of righteousness in the great assembly.<br/>
<span class="indented">Behold, I will not seal my lips, Lord, you know.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> I have not hidden your righteousness within my heart.<br/>
<span class="indented">I have declared your faithfulness and your salvation.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I have not concealed your loving kindness and your truth from the great assembly.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Don’t withhold your tender mercies from me, Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let your loving kindness and your truth continually preserve me.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> For innumerable evils have surrounded me.<br/>
<span class="indented">My iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">They are more than the hairs of my head.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">My heart has failed me.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Be pleased, Lord, to deliver me.<br/>
<span class="indented">Hurry to help me, Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Let them be disappointed and confounded together who seek after my soul to destroy it.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Let them be desolate by reason of their shame that tell me, “Aha! Aha!”<br/>
<sup>16</sup> Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let such as love your salvation say continually, “Let the Lord be exalted!”</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> But I am poor and needy.<br/>
<span class="indented">May the Lord think about me.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">You are my help and my deliverer.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t delay, my God.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 41</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Blessed is he who considers the poor.<br/>
<span class="indented">The Lord will deliver him in the day of evil.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> The Lord will preserve him, and keep him alive.<br/>
<span class="indented">He shall be blessed on the earth,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and he will not surrender him to the will of his enemies.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> The Lord will sustain him on his sickbed,<br/>
<span class="indented">and restore him from his bed of illness.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> I said, “Lord, have mercy on me!<br/>
<span class="indented">Heal me, for I have sinned against you.”</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> My enemies speak evil against me:<br/>
<span class="indented">“When will he die, and his name perish?”</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> If he comes to see me, he speaks falsehood.<br/>
<span class="indented">His heart gathers iniquity to itself.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">When he goes abroad, he tells it.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> All who hate me whisper together against me.<br/>
<span class="indented">They imagine the worst for me.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> “An evil disease,” they say, “has afflicted him.<br/>
<span class="indented">Now that he lies he shall rise up no more.”</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Yes, my own familiar friend, in whom I trusted,<br/>
<span class="indented">who ate bread with me,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">has lifted up his heel against me.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> But you, Lord, have mercy on me, and raise me up,<br/>
<span class="indented">that I may repay them.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> By this I know that you delight in me,<br/>
<span class="indented">because my enemy doesn’t triumph over me.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> As for me, you uphold me in my integrity,<br/>
<span class="indented">and set me in your presence forever.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,<br/>
<span class="indented">from everlasting and to everlasting!</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Amen and amen.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 42</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> As the deer pants for the water brooks,<br/>
<span class="indented">so my soul pants after you, God.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> My soul thirsts for God, for the living God.<br/>
<span class="indented">When shall I come and appear before God?</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> My tears have been my food day and night,<br/>
<span class="indented">while they continually ask me, “Where is your God?”</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> These things I remember, and pour out my soul within me,<br/>
<span class="indented">how I used to go with the crowd, and led them to God’s house,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">with the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping a holy day.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Why are you in despair, my soul?<br/>
<span class="indented">Why are you disturbed within me?</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Hope in God!</span><br/>
<span class="indented">For I shall still praise him for the saving help of his presence.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> My God, my soul is in despair within me.<br/>
<span class="indented">Therefore I remember you from the land of the Jordan,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">the heights of Hermon, from the hill Mizar.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Deep calls to deep at the noise of your waterfalls.<br/>
<span class="indented">All your waves and your billows have swept over me.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> The Lord will command his loving kindness in the daytime.<br/>
<span class="indented">In the night his song shall be with me:</span><br/>
<span class="indented">a prayer to the God of my life.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> I will ask God, my rock, “Why have you forgotten me?<br/>
<span class="indented">Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?”</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> As with a sword in my bones, my adversaries reproach me,<br/>
<span class="indented">while they continually ask me, “Where is your God?”</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Why are you in despair, my soul?<br/>
<span class="indented">Why are you disturbed within me?</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Hope in God!</span><br/>
<span class="indented">For I shall still praise him,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">the saving help of my countenance, and my God.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 8:22–36 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 8:22–36</h4>
<p>
<sup>22</sup> “The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his work,<br/>
<span class="indented">before his deeds of old.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning,<br/>
<span class="indented">before the earth existed.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> When there were no depths, I was born,<br/>
<span class="indented">when there were no springs abounding with water.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> Before the mountains were settled in place,<br/>
<span class="indented">before the hills, I was born;</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> while as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor the beginning of the dust of the world.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> When he established the heavens, I was there.<br/>
<span class="indented">When he set a circle on the surface of the deep,</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> when he established the clouds above,<br/>
<span class="indented">when the springs of the deep became strong,</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> when he set a boundary for the sea,<br/>
<span class="indented">that the waters should not violate his commandment,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">when he marked out the foundations of the earth,</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> then I was the craftsman by his side.<br/>
<span class="indented">I was a delight day by day,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">always rejoicing before him,</span><br/>
<sup>31</sup> rejoicing in his whole world.<br/>
<span class="indented">My delight was with the sons of men.</span><br/>
<sup>32</sup> “Now therefore, my sons, listen to me,<br/>
<span class="indented">for blessed are those who keep my ways.</span><br/>
<sup>33</sup> Hear instruction, and be wise.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t refuse it.</span><br/>
<sup>34</sup> Blessed is the man who hears me,<br/>
<span class="indented">watching daily at my gates,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">waiting at my door posts.</span><br/>
<sup>35</sup> For whoever finds me, finds life,<br/>
<span class="indented">and will obtain favor from the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>36</sup> But he who sins against me wrongs his own soul.<br/>
<span class="indented">All those who hate me love death.”</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 15 -->

<h4>Sirach 15</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> He who fears the Lord will do this;<br/>
<span class="indented">and he who has understanding will find his good pleasure.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> She will meet him like a mother,<br/>
<span class="indented">and will receive him like a wife married in her virginity.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> She will feed him with the bread of understanding,<br/>
<span class="indented">and give him the water of wisdom to drink.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> He will be stayed on her and will not be moved.<br/>
<span class="indented">He will rely on her and will not be confounded.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> She will exalt him above his neighbors.<br/>
<span class="indented">She will open his mouth in the midst of the congregation.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> He will find gladness and a crown of rejoicing.<br/>
<span class="indented">He will inherit an everlasting name.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Foolish men will not attain to her.<br/>
<span class="indented">Sinners will not see her.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> For she is far from pride.<br/>
<span class="indented">Deceitful men can’t remember her.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Praise is not becoming in the mouth of a sinner,<br/>
<span class="indented">for it wasn’t sent to him from the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> For praise will be spoken in wisdom,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the Lord will prosper it.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Don’t say, “It is through the Lord that I fell away,”<br/>
<span class="indented">for you shall not do the things that he hates.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Don’t say, “He has caused me to err,”<br/>
<span class="indented">for he has no need of a sinful man.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> The Lord hates every abomination.<br/>
<span class="indented">They who fear him love it not.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> He himself made man from the beginning,<br/>
<span class="indented">and left him in the hand of his own counsel.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> If you will, you can keep the commandments;<br/>
<span class="indented">and to do faithfully what is acceptable is within your power.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> He has set fire and water before you.<br/>
<span class="indented">You will stretch out your hand for whichever you choose.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Life and death are before man.<br/>
<span class="indented">Whichever he likes will be given to him.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> For the wisdom of the Lord is great.<br/>
<span class="indented">He is mighty in power, and sees all things.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> His eyes are upon those who fear him.<br/>
<span class="indented">He knows every work of man.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> He has commanded no man to do wickedly.<br/>
<span class="indented">He has given no man license to sin.</span> </p></section>

<h2>Day 16</h2>
<!-- Psalms 43, 44, 45 -->
<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 43</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Vindicate me, God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation.<br/>
<span class="indented">Oh, deliver me from deceitful and wicked men.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> For you are the God of my strength. Why have you rejected me?<br/>
<span class="indented">Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Oh, send out your light and your truth. Let them lead me.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let them bring me to your holy hill,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">to your tents.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Then I will go to the altar of God,<br/>
<span class="indented">to God, my exceeding joy.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I will praise you on the harp, God, my God.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Why are you in despair, my soul?<br/>
<span class="indented">Why are you disturbed within me?</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Hope in God!</span><br/>
<span class="indented">For I shall still praise him:</span><br/>
<span class="indented">my Savior, my helper, and my God.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 44</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> We have heard with our ears, God;<br/>
<span class="indented">our fathers have told us what work you did in their days,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">in the days of old.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> You drove out the nations with your hand,<br/>
<span class="indented">but you planted them.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">You afflicted the peoples,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">but you spread them abroad.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> For they didn’t get the land in possession by their own sword,<br/>
<span class="indented">neither did their own arm save them,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">but your right hand, your arm, and the light of your face,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">because you were favorable to them.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> You are my King, God.<br/>
<span class="indented">Command victories for Jacob!</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Through you, we will push down our adversaries.<br/>
<span class="indented">Through your name, we will trample those who rise up against us.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> For I will not trust in my bow,<br/>
<span class="indented">neither shall my sword save me.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> But you have saved us from our adversaries,<br/>
<span class="indented">and have shamed those who hate us.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> In God we have made our boast all day long.<br/>
<span class="indented">We will give thanks to your name forever.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> But now you rejected us, and brought us to dishonor,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t go out with our armies.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> You make us turn back from the adversary.<br/>
<span class="indented">Those who hate us take plunder for themselves.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> You have made us like sheep for food,<br/>
<span class="indented">and have scattered us among the nations.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> You sell your people for nothing,<br/>
<span class="indented">and have gained nothing from their sale.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> You make us a reproach to our neighbors,<br/>
<span class="indented">a scoffing and a derision to those who are around us.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> You make us a byword among the nations,<br/>
<span class="indented">a shaking of the head among the peoples.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> All day long my dishonor is before me,<br/>
<span class="indented">and shame covers my face,</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> at the taunt of one who reproaches and verbally abuses,<br/>
<span class="indented">because of the enemy and the avenger.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> All this has come on us,<br/>
<span class="indented">yet we have not forgotten you.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">We have not been false to your covenant.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> Our heart has not turned back,<br/>
<span class="indented">neither have our steps strayed from your path,</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> though you have crushed us in the haunt of jackals,<br/>
<span class="indented">and covered us with the shadow of death.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> If we have forgotten the name of our God,<br/>
<span class="indented">or spread out our hands to a strange god,</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> won’t God search this out?<br/>
<span class="indented">For he knows the secrets of the heart.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> Yes, for your sake we are killed all day long.<br/>
<span class="indented">We are regarded as sheep for the slaughter.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Wake up! Why do you sleep, Lord?<br/>
<span class="indented">Arise! Don’t reject us forever.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> Why do you hide your face,<br/>
<span class="indented">and forget our affliction and our oppression?</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> For our soul is bowed down to the dust.<br/>
<span class="indented">Our body clings to the earth.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> Rise up to help us.<br/>
<span class="indented">Redeem us for your loving kindness’ sake.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 45</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> My heart overflows with a noble theme.<br/>
<span class="indented">I recite my verses for the king.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">My tongue is like the pen of a skillful writer.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> You are the most excellent of the sons of men.<br/>
<span class="indented">Grace has anointed your lips,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">therefore God has blessed you forever.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Strap your sword on your thigh, mighty one,<br/>
<span class="indented">in your splendor and your majesty.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> In your majesty ride on victoriously on behalf of truth, humility, and righteousness.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let your right hand display awesome deeds.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Your arrows are sharp.<br/>
<span class="indented">The nations fall under you,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">with arrows in the heart of the king’s enemies.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Your throne, God, is forever and ever.<br/>
<span class="indented">A scepter of equity is the scepter of your kingdom.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> You have loved righteousness, and hated wickedness.<br/>
<span class="indented">Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> All your garments smell like myrrh, aloes, and cassia.<br/>
<span class="indented">Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made you glad.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Kings’ daughters are among your honorable women.<br/>
<span class="indented">At your right hand the queen stands in gold of Ophir.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Listen, daughter, consider, and turn your ear.<br/>
<span class="indented">Forget your own people, and also your father’s house.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> So the king will desire your beauty.<br/>
<span class="indented">Honor him, for he is your lord.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> The daughter of Tyre comes with a gift.<br/>
<span class="indented">The rich among the people entreat your favor.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> The princess inside is all glorious.<br/>
<span class="indented">Her clothing is interwoven with gold.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> She shall be led to the king in embroidered work.<br/>
<span class="indented">The virgins, her companions who follow her, shall be brought to you.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> With gladness and rejoicing they shall be led.<br/>
<span class="indented">They shall enter into the king’s palace.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Your sons will take the place of your fathers.<br/>
<span class="indented">You shall make them princes in all the earth.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> I will make your name to be remembered in all generations.<br/>
<span class="indented">Therefore the peoples shall give you thanks forever and ever.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 9:1–18 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 9:1–18</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Wisdom has built her house.<br/>
<span class="indented">She has carved out her seven pillars.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> She has prepared her meat.<br/>
<span class="indented">She has mixed her wine.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">She has also set her table.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> She has sent out her maidens.<br/>
<span class="indented">She cries from the highest places of the city:</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!”<br/>
<span class="indented">As for him who is void of understanding, she says to him,</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> “Come, eat some of my bread,<br/>
<span class="indented">Drink some of the wine which I have mixed!</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Leave your simple ways, and live.<br/>
<span class="indented">Walk in the way of understanding.”</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> He who corrects a mocker invites insult.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who reproves a wicked man invites abuse.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Don’t reprove a scoffer, lest he hate you.<br/>
<span class="indented">Reprove a wise person, and he will love you.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Instruct a wise person, and he will be still wiser.<br/>
<span class="indented">Teach a righteous person, and he will increase in learning.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.<br/>
<span class="indented">The knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> For by me your days will be multiplied.<br/>
<span class="indented">The years of your life will be increased.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> If you are wise, you are wise for yourself.<br/>
<span class="indented">If you mock, you alone will bear it.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> The foolish woman is loud,<br/>
<span class="indented">undisciplined, and knows nothing.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> She sits at the door of her house,<br/>
<span class="indented">on a seat in the high places of the city,</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> to call to those who pass by,<br/>
<span class="indented">who go straight on their ways,</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here.”<br/>
<span class="indented">As for him who is void of understanding, she says to him,</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> “Stolen water is sweet.<br/>
<span class="indented">Food eaten in secret is pleasant.”</span><br/>

<span class="indented">that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 16 -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 16</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Don’t desire a multitude of unprofitable children,<br/>
<span class="indented">neither delight in ungodly sons.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Even though they multiply, don’t delight in them,<br/>
<span class="indented">unless the fear of the Lord is in them.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Don’t trust in their life,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t rely on their multitude;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for one is better than a thousand,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and to die childless is better than to have ungodly children.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> For one who has understanding will populate a city,<br/>
<span class="indented">but a race of wicked men will be made desolate.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> My eyes have seen many things.<br/>
<span class="indented">My ear has heard stronger things than these.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> In the congregation of sinners, a fire will be kindled.<br/>
<span class="indented">In a disobedient nation, wrath is kindled.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> He was not pacified toward the giants of old,<br/>
<span class="indented">who revolted in their might.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> He didn’t spare Lot’s neighbors,<br/>
<span class="indented">whom he abhorred for their pride.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> He didn’t pity the people of perdition,<br/>
<span class="indented">who were taken away in their sins.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> In like manner, he didn’t pity the six hundred thousand footmen<br/>
<span class="indented">who were gathered together in the hardness of their hearts.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Even if there is only one stiff-necked person,<br/>
<span class="indented">it will be a wonder if he remains unpunished;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for mercy and wrath are with him;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">he is mighty to forgive, and he pours out wrath.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> As his mercy is great, so is his correction also.<br/>
<span class="indented">He judges a man according to his works.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> The sinner will not escape with plunder.<br/>
<span class="indented">The perseverance of the godly will not be frustrated.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> He will make room for every work of mercy.<br/>
<span class="indented">Each man will receive according to his works.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> The Lord hardened Pharaoh so that he wouldn’t know him,<br/>
<span class="indented">that his works might be widely known throughout the earth.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> His mercy is revealed to every creature;<br/>
<span class="indented">and he has separated his light from the darkness with a adamant.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Don’t say, “I will hide myself from the Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">Who will remember me from on high?</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I will not be known among so many people;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for what is my soul in such an immense creation?”</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens,<br/>
<span class="indented">the deep, and the earth will be shaken when he visits.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> The mountains also and foundations of the earth will tremble with trembling<br/>
<span class="indented">when he looks on them.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> No heart can think about these things worthily.<br/>
<span class="indented">Who will consider his ways?</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> There is a storm that no man sees.<br/>
<span class="indented">Most of his works are hidden.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> Who will declare the works of his righteousness?<br/>
<span class="indented">Or who will endure them?</span><br/>
<span class="indented">For his covenant is far off.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">It is the trial of all things.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> He who lacks understanding thinks about these things vainly.<br/>
<span class="indented">A senseless and erring man thinks foolishly.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> My son, listen to me, and learn knowledge.<br/>
<span class="indented">Heed my words in your heart.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> I will show forth discipline in balance,<br/>
<span class="indented">and declare knowledge exactly.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> The works of the Lord are done in judgment from the beginning.<br/>
<span class="indented">From their institution, he measured them.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> He set his works in order forever.<br/>
<span class="indented">Their beginning and their generations are by their seasons.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">They have not hunger nor labor,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and they cease not from their works.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> No one crowds his neighbor.<br/>
<span class="indented">They will never disobey his word.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> After this the Lord looked and filled them with his blessing.<br/>
<sup>30</sup> Their ways are strong to their good.<br/>
<span class="indented">Each covers the face of the earth;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and all flesh is covered with the same substance.</span> </p></section>

<!-- Psalms 46, 47, 48 -->
<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 46</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> God is our refuge and strength,<br/>
<span class="indented">a very present help in trouble.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Therefore we won’t be afraid, though the earth changes,<br/>
<span class="indented">though the mountains are shaken into the heart of the seas;</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> though its waters roar and are troubled,<br/>
<span class="indented">though the mountains tremble with their swelling.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> There is a river, the streams of which make the city of God glad,<br/>
<span class="indented">the holy place of the tents of the Most High.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> God is within her. She shall not be moved.<br/>
<span class="indented">God will help her at dawn.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> The nations raged. The kingdoms were moved.<br/>
<span class="indented">He lifted his voice, and the earth melted.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> The Lord of Armies is with us.<br/>
<span class="indented">The God of Jacob is our refuge.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Come, see the Lord’s works,<br/>
<span class="indented">what desolations he has made in the earth.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> He makes wars cease to the end of the earth.<br/>
<span class="indented">He breaks the bow, and shatters the spear.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He burns the chariots in the fire.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> “Be still, and know that I am God.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will be exalted among the nations.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I will be exalted in the earth.”</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> The Lord of Armies is with us.<br/>
<span class="indented">The God of Jacob is our refuge.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 47</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Oh clap your hands, all you nations.<br/>
<span class="indented">Shout to God with the voice of triumph!</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> For the Lord Most High is awesome.<br/>
<span class="indented">He is a great King over all the earth.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> He subdues nations under us,<br/>
<span class="indented">and peoples under our feet.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> He chooses our inheritance for us,<br/>
<span class="indented">the glory of Jacob whom he loved.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> God has gone up with a shout,<br/>
<span class="indented">the Lord with the sound of a trumpet.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Sing praise to God, sing praises.<br/>
<span class="indented">Sing praises to our King, sing praises.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> For God is the King of all the earth.<br/>
<span class="indented">Sing praises with understanding.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> God reigns over the nations.<br/>
<span class="indented">God sits on his holy throne.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> The princes of the peoples are gathered together,<br/>
<span class="indented">the people of the God of Abraham.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">For the shields of the earth belong to God.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He is greatly exalted!</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 48</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised,<br/>
<span class="indented">in the city of our God, in his holy mountain.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth,<br/>
<span class="indented">is Mount Zion, on the north sides,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">the city of the great King.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> God has shown himself in her citadels as a refuge.<br/>
<sup>4</sup> For, behold, the kings assembled themselves.<br/>
<span class="indented">They passed by together.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> They saw it, then they were amazed.<br/>
<span class="indented">They were dismayed.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">They hurried away.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Trembling took hold of them there,<br/>
<span class="indented">pain as of a woman in travail.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> With the east wind, you break the ships of Tarshish.<br/>
<sup>8</sup> As we have heard, so we have seen,<br/>
<span class="indented">in the city of the Lord of Armies, in the city of our God.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">God will establish it forever.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> We have thought about your loving kindness, God,<br/>
<span class="indented">in the middle of your temple.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> As is your name, God,<br/>
<span class="indented">so is your praise to the ends of the earth.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Your right hand is full of righteousness.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Let Mount Zion be glad!<br/>
<span class="indented">Let the daughters of Judah rejoice because of your judgments.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Walk about Zion, and go around her.<br/>
<span class="indented">Number its towers.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Notice her bulwarks.<br/>
<span class="indented">Consider her palaces,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">that you may tell it to the next generation.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> For this God is our God forever and ever.<br/>
<span class="indented">He will be our guide even to death.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 10:1–16 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 10:1–16</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> The proverbs of Solomon.<br/>
<span class="indented">A wise son makes a glad father;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">but a foolish son brings grief to his mother.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Treasures of wickedness profit nothing,<br/>
<span class="indented">but righteousness delivers from death.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> The Lord will not allow the soul of the righteous to go hungry,<br/>
<span class="indented">but he thrusts away the desire of the wicked.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> He becomes poor who works with a lazy hand,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the hand of the diligent brings wealth.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> He who gathers in summer is a wise son,<br/>
<span class="indented">but he who sleeps during the harvest is a son who causes shame.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Blessings are on the head of the righteous,<br/>
<span class="indented">but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> The memory of the righteous is blessed,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the name of the wicked will rot.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> The wise in heart accept commandments,<br/>
<span class="indented">but a chattering fool will fall.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> He who walks blamelessly walks surely,<br/>
<span class="indented">but he who perverts his ways will be found out.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> One winking with the eye causes sorrow,<br/>
<span class="indented">but a chattering fool will fall.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> The mouth of the righteous is a spring of life,<br/>
<span class="indented">but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Hatred stirs up strife,<br/>
<span class="indented">but love covers all wrongs.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Wisdom is found on the lips of him who has discernment,<br/>
<span class="indented">but a rod is for the back of him who is void of understanding.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Wise men lay up knowledge,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the mouth of the foolish is near ruin.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> The rich man’s wealth is his strong city.<br/>
<span class="indented">The destruction of the poor is their poverty.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> The labor of the righteous leads to life.<br/>
<span class="indented">The increase of the wicked leads to sin.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 17 -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 17</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> The Lord created man out of earth,<br/>
<span class="indented">and turned him back to it again.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> He gave them days by number and a set time,<br/>
<span class="indented">and gave them authority over the things that are on it.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> He endowed them with strength proper to them,<br/>
<span class="indented">and made them according to his own image.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> He put the fear of man upon all flesh,<br/>
<span class="indented">and gave him to have dominion over animals and birds.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> They received the use of the five operations of the Lord;<br/>
<span class="indented">as sixth he endowed them with understanding,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and as seventh, speech—an interpreter of the thoughts of their heart.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> He filled them with knowledge and understanding,<br/>
<span class="indented">and showed them good and evil.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> He set his eye upon their hearts,<br/>
<span class="indented">that he might show them the majesty of his works.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> They will praise his holy name,<br/>
<span class="indented">that they may declare the magnificence of his works.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> He added to them knowledge,<br/>
<span class="indented">and gave them a law of life for a heritage.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> He made an everlasting covenant with them,<br/>
<span class="indented">and showed them his decrees.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Their eyes saw the majesty of his glory.<br/>
<span class="indented">Their ears heard his glorious voice.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> He said to them, “Beware of all unrighteousness.”<br/>
<span class="indented">Then he gave each man commandment concerning his neighbor.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Their ways are always before him.<br/>
<span class="indented">They will not be hidden from his eyes.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> He appointed a ruler for every nation,<br/>
<span class="indented">but Israel is the Lord’s portion.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> All their works are as clear as the sun before him.<br/>
<span class="indented">His eyes are continually on their ways.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Their iniquities are not hidden from him.<br/>
<span class="indented">All their sins are before the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> His mercy is as great as his majesty.<br/>
<span class="indented">He judges man according to his works.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> The sinner will not escape with plunder;<br/>
<span class="indented">the perseverance of him who trusts in the Lord will not be frustrated.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> All works of mercy are as a sign of love.<br/>
<sup>20</sup> Man’s almsgiving is as a signet with him,<br/>
<span class="indented">and he will keep the good deeds of man as the apple of the eye,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and give repayment to their sons and daughters.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> Afterward he will rise up and repay them.<br/>
<span class="indented">He will bring their recompense on their heads.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> However, to those who repent he grants a return.<br/>
<span class="indented">He comforts those who are losing hope.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Return to the Lord, and forsake your sins.<br/>
<span class="indented">Make your prayer before his face, and offend less.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> Turn again to the Most High, and turn away from iniquity.<br/>
<span class="indented">Greatly hate the abominable thing.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> Who will give praise to the Most High in the grave,<br/>
<span class="indented">instead of those who are alive and return thanks?</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> Thanksgiving perishes from the dead, as from one who doesn’t exist.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who is alive and well will praise the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> How great is the loving kindness of the Lord, and his mercy to those who turn to him!<br/>
<sup>28</sup> For all things can’t be in men,<br/>
<span class="indented">because the son of man is not immortal.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> What is brighter than the sun? Yet it fades.<br/>
<span class="indented">Flesh and blood will devise evil.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> He looks upon the power of the height of heaven,<br/>
<span class="indented">and all men are earth and ashes.</span> </p></section>

<h2>Day 18</h2>
<!-- Psalms 49, 50 -->
<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 49</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Hear this, all you peoples.<br/>
<span class="indented">Listen, all you inhabitants of the world,</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> both low and high,<br/>
<span class="indented">rich and poor together.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> My mouth will speak words of wisdom.<br/>
<span class="indented">My heart will utter understanding.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> I will incline my ear to a proverb.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will open my riddle on the harp.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Why should I fear in the days of evil,<br/>
<span class="indented">when iniquity at my heels surrounds me?</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Those who trust in their wealth,<br/>
<span class="indented">and boast in the multitude of their riches—</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> none of them can by any means redeem his brother,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor give God a ransom for him.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> For the redemption of their life is costly,<br/>
<span class="indented">no payment is ever enough,</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> that he should live on forever,<br/>
<span class="indented">that he should not see corruption.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> For he sees that wise men die;<br/>
<span class="indented">likewise the fool and the senseless perish,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and leave their wealth to others.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Their inward thought is that their houses will endure forever,<br/>
<span class="indented">and their dwelling places to all generations.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">They name their lands after themselves.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> But man, despite his riches, doesn’t endure.<br/>
<span class="indented">He is like the animals that perish.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> This is the destiny of those who are foolish,<br/>
<span class="indented">and of those who approve their sayings.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> They are appointed as a flock for Sheol.<br/>
<span class="indented">Death shall be their shepherd.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">The upright shall have dominion over them in the morning.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Their beauty shall decay in Sheol,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">far from their mansion.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol,<br/>
<span class="indented">for he will receive me.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Don’t be afraid when a man is made rich,<br/>
<span class="indented">when the glory of his house is increased;</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> for when he dies he will carry nothing away.<br/>
<span class="indented">His glory won’t descend after him.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> Though while he lived he blessed his soul—<br/>
<span class="indented">and men praise you when you do well for yourself—</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> he shall go to the generation of his fathers.<br/>
<span class="indented">They shall never see the light.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> A man who has riches without understanding,<br/>
<span class="indented">is like the animals that perish.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 50</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> The Mighty One, God, the Lord, speaks,<br/>
<span class="indented">and calls the earth from sunrise to sunset.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty,<br/>
<span class="indented">God shines out.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Our God comes, and does not keep silent.<br/>
<span class="indented">A fire devours before him.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">It is very stormy around him.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> He calls to the heavens above,<br/>
<span class="indented">to the earth, that he may judge his people:</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> “Gather my saints together to me,<br/>
<span class="indented">those who have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.”</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> The heavens shall declare his righteousness,<br/>
<span class="indented">for God himself is judge.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> “Hear, my people, and I will speak;<br/>
<span class="indented">Israel, and I will testify against you.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I am God, your God.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> I don’t rebuke you for your sacrifices.<br/>
<span class="indented">Your burnt offerings are continually before me.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> I have no need for a bull from your stall,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor male goats from your pens.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> For every animal of the forest is mine,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the livestock on a thousand hills.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> I know all the birds of the mountains.<br/>
<span class="indented">The wild animals of the field are mine.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> If I were hungry, I would not tell you,<br/>
<span class="indented">for the world is mine, and all that is in it.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Will I eat the meat of bulls,<br/>
<span class="indented">or drink the blood of goats?</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Offer to God the sacrifice of thanksgiving.<br/>
<span class="indented">Pay your vows to the Most High.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Call on me in the day of trouble.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will deliver you, and you will honor me.”</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> But to the wicked God says,<br/>
<span class="indented">“What right do you have to declare my statutes,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">that you have taken my covenant on your lips,</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> since you hate instruction,<br/>
<span class="indented">and throw my words behind you?</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> When you saw a thief, you consented with him,<br/>
<span class="indented">and have participated with adulterers.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> You give your mouth to evil.<br/>
<span class="indented">You harness your tongue for deceit.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> You sit and speak against your brother.<br/>
<span class="indented">You slander your own mother’s son.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> You have done these things, and I kept silent.<br/>
<span class="indented">You thought that I was just like you.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I will rebuke you, and accuse you in front of your eyes.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> “Now consider this, you who forget God,<br/>
<span class="indented">lest I tear you into pieces, and there be no one to deliver.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Whoever offers the sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifies me,<br/>
<span class="indented">and prepares his way so that I will show God’s salvation to him.”</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 10:17–32 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 10:17–32</h4>
<p>
<sup>17</sup> He is in the way of life who heeds correction,<br/>
<span class="indented">but he who forsakes reproof leads others astray.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> He who hides hatred has lying lips.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who utters a slander is a fool.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> In the multitude of words there is no lack of disobedience,<br/>
<span class="indented">but he who restrains his lips does wisely.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> The tongue of the righteous is like choice silver.<br/>
<span class="indented">The heart of the wicked is of little worth.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> The lips of the righteous feed many,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the foolish die for lack of understanding.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> The Lord’s blessing brings wealth,<br/>
<span class="indented">and he adds no trouble to it.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> It is a fool’s pleasure to do wickedness,<br/>
<span class="indented">but wisdom is a man of understanding’s pleasure.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> What the wicked fear, will overtake them,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the desire of the righteous will be granted.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> When the whirlwind passes, the wicked is no more;<br/>
<span class="indented">but the righteous stand firm forever.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes,<br/>
<span class="indented">so is the sluggard to those who send him.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> The fear of the Lord prolongs days,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> The prospect of the righteous is joy,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the hope of the wicked will perish.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> The way of the Lord is a stronghold to the upright,<br/>
<span class="indented">but it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> The righteous will never be removed,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the wicked will not dwell in the land.</span><br/>
<sup>31</sup> The mouth of the righteous produces wisdom,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the perverse tongue will be cut off.</span><br/>
<sup>32</sup> The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the mouth of the wicked is perverse.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 18 -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 18</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> He who lives forever created all things in common.<br/>
<sup>2</sup> The Lord alone is righteous,<br/>
<span class="indented">and there is no other beside him;</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> who governs the world with the palm of his hand,<br/>
<span class="indented">and all things obey his will;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for he is King of all by his power,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">separating out holy things among them from profane.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> To whom has he given power to declare his works?<br/>
<span class="indented">Who will trace out his majestic deeds?</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Who will number the strength of his majesty?<br/>
<span class="indented">Who will also tell out his mercies?</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> As for the wondrous works of the Lord, it is impossible to make them all known.<br/>
<sup>7</sup> When a man has finished, then he is just beginning,<br/>
<span class="indented">and when he stops, he will be in need.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> What is man? To what purpose does he serve?<br/>
<span class="indented">What is his good, and what is his evil?</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> The number of man’s days at the most are a hundred years.<br/>
<sup>10</sup> As a drop of water from the sea, and a pebble from the sand,<br/>
<span class="indented">so are a few years in the day of eternity.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Therefore the Lord was patient with them,<br/>
<span class="indented">and poured out his mercy on them.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> He saw and perceived their end, that it is evil;<br/>
<span class="indented">therefore he multiplied his forgiveness.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> The mercy of man is for his neighbor,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the mercy of the Lord is for all flesh,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">reproving, disciplining, teaching,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and bringing again as a shepherd does his flock.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> He has mercy on those who accept discipline,<br/>
<span class="indented">and who diligently seek after his judgments.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> My son, to your good deeds don’t add reproach;<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t give a distressed heart with your gifts.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Doesn’t dew relieve the scorching heat?<br/>
<span class="indented">So a word is better than a gift.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Behold, isn’t a word better than a gift?<br/>
<span class="indented">Both are with a gracious man.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> A fool is ungracious and abusive,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the gift of a grudging man makes the eyes dim.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> Learn before you speak.<br/>
<span class="indented">Take care of your health before you get sick.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> Examine yourself before judgment,<br/>
<span class="indented">and in the day of visitation you will find forgiveness.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> Humble yourself before you get sick,<br/>
<span class="indented">and in the time of sins show repentance.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> Let nothing hinder you from paying a vow in due time;<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t wait until death to be justified.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Before you make a vow, prepare yourself.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t be like a man who tempts the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> Think about his wrath on the day of death,<br/>
<span class="indented">and remember the end of wrath when he turns away his face.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> In the time of plenty, remember the time of hunger.<br/>
<span class="indented">In the days of wealth, think about poverty and need.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> From morning until evening, circumstances change;<br/>
<span class="indented">and all things are speedy before the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> A wise man will fear in everything.<br/>
<span class="indented">In the days of sinning he will beware of offense,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">but a fool will not observe times.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> Every man of understanding knows wisdom,<br/>
<span class="indented">and he will give thanks to him who found her.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> Those who were of understanding in sayings also became wise themselves,<br/>
<span class="indented">and poured out apt proverbs.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> Don’t go after your desires.<br/>
<span class="indented">Restrain your appetites.</span><br/>
<sup>31</sup> If you give fully to your soul the satisfaction of your lust,<br/>
<span class="indented">it will make you the laughingstock of your enemies.</span><br/>
<sup>32</sup> Don’t make merry in great luxury;<br/>
<span class="indented">lest you become needy by its expense.</span><br/>
<sup>33</sup> Don’t become a beggar by feasting on borrowed money<br/>
<span class="indented">when you have nothing in your purse.</span> </p></section>

<h2>Day 19</h2>
<!-- Psalms 51, 52, 53, 54 -->
<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 51</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Have mercy on me, God, according to your loving kindness.<br/>
<span class="indented">According to the multitude of your tender mercies, blot out my transgressions.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity.<br/>
<span class="indented">Cleanse me from my sin.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> For I know my transgressions.<br/>
<span class="indented">My sin is constantly before me.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Against you, and you only, I have sinned,<br/>
<span class="indented">and done that which is evil in your sight,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">so you may be proved right when you speak,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and justified when you judge.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Behold, I was born in iniquity.<br/>
<span class="indented">My mother conceived me in sin.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Behold, you desire truth in the inward parts.<br/>
<span class="indented">You teach me wisdom in the inmost place.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean.<br/>
<span class="indented">Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Let me hear joy and gladness,<br/>
<span class="indented">that the bones which you have broken may rejoice.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Hide your face from my sins,<br/>
<span class="indented">and blot out all of my iniquities.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Create in me a clean heart, O God.<br/>
<span class="indented">Renew a right spirit within me.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Don’t throw me from your presence,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t take your Holy Spirit from me.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Restore to me the joy of your salvation.<br/>
<span class="indented">Uphold me with a willing spirit.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Then I will teach transgressors your ways.<br/>
<span class="indented">Sinners shall be converted to you.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, O God, the God of my salvation.<br/>
<span class="indented">My tongue shall sing aloud of your righteousness.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Lord, open my lips.<br/>
<span class="indented">My mouth shall declare your praise.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> For you don’t delight in sacrifice, or else I would give it.<br/>
<span class="indented">You have no pleasure in burnt offering.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit.<br/>
<span class="indented">O God, you will not despise a broken and contrite heart.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> Do well in your good pleasure to Zion.<br/>
<span class="indented">Build the walls of Jerusalem.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> Then you will delight in the sacrifices of righteousness,<br/>
<span class="indented">in burnt offerings and in whole burnt offerings.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Then they will offer bulls on your altar.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 52</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Why do you boast of mischief, mighty man?<br/>
<span class="indented">God’s loving kindness endures continually.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Your tongue plots destruction,<br/>
<span class="indented">like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> You love evil more than good,<br/>
<span class="indented">lying rather than speaking the truth.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> You love all devouring words,<br/>
<span class="indented">you deceitful tongue.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> God will likewise destroy you forever.<br/>
<span class="indented">He will take you up and pluck you out of your tent,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and root you out of the land of the living.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> The righteous also will see it, and fear,<br/>
<span class="indented">and laugh at him, saying,</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> “Behold, this is the man who didn’t make God his strength,<br/>
<span class="indented">but trusted in the abundance of his riches,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and strengthened himself in his wickedness.”</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in God’s house.<br/>
<span class="indented">I trust in God’s loving kindness forever and ever.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> I will give you thanks forever, because you have done it.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will hope in your name, for it is good,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">in the presence of your saints.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 53</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.”<br/>
<span class="indented">They are corrupt, and have done abominable iniquity.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">There is no one who does good.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> God looks down from heaven on the children of men,<br/>
<span class="indented">to see if there are any who understood,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">who sought after God.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Every one of them has gone back.<br/>
<span class="indented">They have become filthy together.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">There is no one who does good, no, not one.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge,<br/>
<span class="indented">who eat up my people as they eat bread,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t call on God?</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> There they were in great fear, where no fear was.<br/>
<span class="indented">For God has scattered the bones of him who encamps against you.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">You have put them to shame,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">because God has rejected them.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion!<br/>
<span class="indented">When God brings back the captivity of his people,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">then Jacob shall rejoice,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and Israel shall be glad.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 54</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Save me, God, by your name.<br/>
<span class="indented">Vindicate me in your might.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Hear my prayer, God.<br/>
<span class="indented">Listen to the words of my mouth.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> For strangers have risen up against me.<br/>
<span class="indented">Violent men have sought after my soul.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">They haven’t set God before them.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Behold, God is my helper.<br/>
<span class="indented">The Lord is the one who sustains my soul.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> He will repay the evil to my enemies.<br/>
<span class="indented">Destroy them in your truth.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> With a free will offering, I will sacrifice to you.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will give thanks to your name, Lord, for it is good.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> For he has delivered me out of all trouble.<br/>
<span class="indented">My eye has seen triumph over my enemies.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 11:1–15 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 11:1–15</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> A false balance is an abomination to the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">but accurate weights are his delight.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> When pride comes, then comes shame,<br/>
<span class="indented">but with humility comes wisdom.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> The integrity of the upright shall guide them,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the perverseness of the treacherous shall destroy them.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Riches don’t profit in the day of wrath,<br/>
<span class="indented">but righteousness delivers from death.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> The righteousness of the blameless will direct his way,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the unfaithful will be trapped by evil desires.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> When a wicked man dies, hope perishes,<br/>
<span class="indented">and expectation of power comes to nothing.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> A righteous person is delivered out of trouble,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the wicked takes his place.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> With his mouth, the godless man destroys his neighbor,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the righteous will be delivered through knowledge.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices.<br/>
<span class="indented">When the wicked perish, there is shouting.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> By the blessing of the upright, the city is exalted,<br/>
<span class="indented">but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> One who despises his neighbor is void of wisdom,<br/>
<span class="indented">but a man of understanding holds his peace.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> One who brings gossip betrays a confidence,<br/>
<span class="indented">but one who is of a trustworthy spirit is one who keeps a secret.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Where there is no wise guidance, the nation falls,<br/>
<span class="indented">but in the multitude of counselors there is victory.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> He who is collateral for a stranger will suffer for it,<br/>
<span class="indented">but he who refuses pledges of collateral is secure.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 19 -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 19</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> A laborer who is a drunkard will not become rich.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who despises small things will fall little by little.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Wine and women will make men of understanding fall away.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who joins himself to prostitutes is a hero of confusion.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Moths and worms will have him as their heritage.<br/>
<span class="indented">A reckless soul will be taken away.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> One who trusts quickly has a shallow heart,<br/>
<span class="indented">and one who sins does wrong to his own soul.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> One who rejoices in wickedness will be condemned,<br/>
<span class="indented">but one who hates talking has less wickedness.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Never repeat a discourse, and you won’t lose anything.<br/>
<sup>7</sup> Don’t talk about it to friend or foe,<br/>
<span class="indented">and unless it is a sin to you, don’t reveal it.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> For he has heard you and observed you,<br/>
<span class="indented">and when the time comes he will hate you.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Have you heard a word? Let it die with you.<br/>
<span class="indented">Be brave! It will not burst you.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> A fool will travail in pain with a word,<br/>
<span class="indented">as a woman in labor with a child.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> As an arrow stuck in a thigh of flesh,<br/>
<span class="indented">so is a word in a fool’s belly.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Reprove a friend. It may be he didn’t do it.<br/>
<span class="indented">If he did, that he may not do it again.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Reprove your neighbor. It may be he didn’t say it.<br/>
<span class="indented">If he has said it, that he may not say it again.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Reprove a friend, for there is often slander,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t trust every rumor.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> There is one who slips, and not from the heart.<br/>
<span class="indented">Who has not sinned with his tongue?</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Reprove your neighbor before you threaten him,<br/>
<span class="indented">and give place to the law of the Most High.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> The fear of the Lord is the first step to be accepted;<br/>
<span class="indented">wisdom obtains his love.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> The knowledge of the commandments of the Lord is life-giving instruction.<br/>
<span class="indented">Those who practice the things that please him will receive the fruit of the tree of immortality.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> All wisdom is the fear of the Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">In all wisdom is the fulfilling of the law.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> The knowledge of wickedness is not wisdom.<br/>
<span class="indented">The prudence of sinners is not counsel.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> There is a cleverness which is an abomination.<br/>
<span class="indented">There is a fool lacking in wisdom.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> Better is the one who has small understanding and fears,<br/>
<span class="indented">than one who has much prudence and transgresses the law.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> There is an exquisite subtlety, and it is unjust.<br/>
<span class="indented">There is one who distorts favor to gain judgment.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> There is one who does wickedly, bowed down in mourning;<br/>
<span class="indented">but inwardly he is full of deceit.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> There is one who humbles himself exceedingly with a great lowliness,<br/>
<span class="indented">but there is one who hangs down his head and pretends.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> By such ways one sits bowed down,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the other stares and dissimulates,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">or he will be unknown by reason of his concealment,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and will be enabled to do harm without being noticed.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> If you don’t take heed to yourself in such a person,<br/>
<span class="indented">you will be overthrown before you are aware of it.</span> </p></section>

<h2>Day 20</h2>
<!-- Psalms 55, 56 -->
<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 55</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Listen to my prayer, God.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t hide yourself from my supplication.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Attend to me, and answer me.<br/>
<span class="indented">I am restless in my complaint,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and moan</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> because of the voice of the enemy,<br/>
<span class="indented">because of the oppression of the wicked.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">For they bring suffering on me.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">In anger they hold a grudge against me.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> My heart is severely pained within me.<br/>
<span class="indented">The terrors of death have fallen on me.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Fearfulness and trembling have come on me.<br/>
<span class="indented">Horror has overwhelmed me.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> I said, “Oh that I had wings like a dove!<br/>
<span class="indented">Then I would fly away, and be at rest.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Behold, then I would wander far off.<br/>
<span class="indented">I would lodge in the wilderness.”</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> “I would hurry to a shelter from the stormy wind and storm.”<br/>
<sup>9</sup> Confuse them, Lord, and confound their language,<br/>
<span class="indented">for I have seen violence and strife in the city.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Day and night they prowl around on its walls.<br/>
<span class="indented">Malice and abuse are also within her.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Destructive forces are within her.<br/>
<span class="indented">Threats and lies don’t depart from her streets.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> For it was not an enemy who insulted me,<br/>
<span class="indented">then I could have endured it.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Neither was it he who hated me who raised himself up against me,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">then I would have hidden myself from him.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> But it was you, a man like me,<br/>
<span class="indented">my companion, and my familiar friend.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> We took sweet fellowship together.<br/>
<span class="indented">We walked in God’s house with company.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Let death come suddenly on them.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let them go down alive into Sheol.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">For wickedness is among them, in their dwelling.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> As for me, I will call on God.<br/>
<span class="indented">The Lord will save me.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Evening, morning, and at noon, I will cry out in distress.<br/>
<span class="indented">He will hear my voice.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> He has redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me,<br/>
<span class="indented">although there are many who oppose me.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> God, who is enthroned forever,<br/>
<span class="indented">will hear, and answer them.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">They never change</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t fear God.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> He raises his hands against his friends.<br/>
<span class="indented">He has violated his covenant.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> His mouth was smooth as butter,<br/>
<span class="indented">but his heart was war.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">His words were softer than oil,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">yet they were drawn swords.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> Cast your burden on the Lord, and he will sustain you.<br/>
<span class="indented">He will never allow the righteous to be moved.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> But you, God, will bring them down into the pit of destruction.<br/>
<span class="indented">Bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">but I will trust in you.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 56</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Be merciful to me, God, for man wants to swallow me up.<br/>
<span class="indented">All day long, he attacks and oppresses me.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> My enemies want to swallow me up all day long,<br/>
<span class="indented">for they are many who fight proudly against me.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> When I am afraid,<br/>
<span class="indented">I will put my trust in you.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> In God, I praise his word.<br/>
<span class="indented">In God, I put my trust.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I will not be afraid.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">What can flesh do to me?</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> All day long they twist my words.<br/>
<span class="indented">All their thoughts are against me for evil.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> They conspire and lurk.<br/>
<span class="indented">They watch my steps, they are eager to take my life.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Shall they escape by iniquity?<br/>
<span class="indented">In anger cast down the peoples, God.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> You count my wanderings.<br/>
<span class="indented">You put my tears into your container.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Aren’t they in your book?</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Then my enemies shall turn back in the day that I call.<br/>
<span class="indented">I know this: that God is for me.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> In God, I will praise his word.<br/>
<span class="indented">In the Lord, I will praise his word.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> I have put my trust in God.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will not be afraid.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">What can man do to me?</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Your vows are on me, God.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will give thank offerings to you.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> For you have delivered my soul from death,<br/>
<span class="indented">and prevented my feet from falling,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">that I may walk before God in the light of the living.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 11:16–31 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 11:16–31</h4>
<p>
<sup>16</sup> A gracious woman obtains honor,<br/>
<span class="indented">but violent men obtain riches.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> The merciful man does good to his own soul,<br/>
<span class="indented">but he who is cruel troubles his own flesh.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> Wicked people earn deceitful wages,<br/>
<span class="indented">but one who sows righteousness reaps a sure reward.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> He who is truly righteous gets life.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who pursues evil gets death.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> Those who are perverse in heart are an abomination to the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">but those whose ways are blameless are his delight.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> Most certainly, the evil man will not be unpunished,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the offspring of the righteous will be delivered.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> Like a gold ring in a pig’s snout,<br/>
<span class="indented">is a beautiful woman who lacks discretion.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> The desire of the righteous is only good.<br/>
<span class="indented">The expectation of the wicked is wrath.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> There is one who scatters, and increases yet more.<br/>
<span class="indented">There is one who withholds more than is appropriate, but gains poverty.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> The liberal soul shall be made fat.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who waters shall be watered also himself.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> People curse someone who withholds grain,<br/>
<span class="indented">but blessing will be on the head of him who sells it.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> He who diligently seeks good seeks favor,<br/>
<span class="indented">but he who searches after evil, it shall come to him.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> He who trusts in his riches will fall,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the righteous shall flourish like the green leaf.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> He who troubles his own house shall inherit the wind.<br/>
<span class="indented">The foolish shall be servant to the wise of heart.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who is wise wins souls.</span><br/>
<sup>31</sup> Behold, the righteous shall be repaid in the earth;<br/>
<span class="indented">how much more the wicked and the sinner!</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 20 -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 20</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> There is a reproof which is not timely,<br/>
<span class="indented">and there is a man who keeps silent and is wise.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> How good it is to reprove rather than to stay angry!<br/>
<span class="indented">He who confesses will be kept from loss.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Like a eunuch who desires to violate a virgin is he<br/>
<span class="indented">who executes judgments by violence.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> One man keeps silent, and is found wise;<br/>
<span class="indented">another is hated for his much talking.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> One man keeps silent, for he has no answer to give;<br/>
<span class="indented">and another keeps silent, knowing his time.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> A wise man will be silent until the right moment;<br/>
<span class="indented">but the braggart and fool goes beyond the right moment.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> He who uses many words will be abhorred.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who takes authority for himself will be hated.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> There is a prosperity in the midst of adversity;<br/>
<span class="indented">and there is a gain in the midst of loss.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> There is a gift that will not profit you;<br/>
<span class="indented">and there is a gift whose repayment is double.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> There is an abasement because of glory;<br/>
<span class="indented">and there is one who has lifted up his head from a low estate.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> There is one who buys much for a small price,<br/>
<span class="indented">yet pays for it again seven times over.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> A wise man makes himself beloved by his words;<br/>
<span class="indented">but the courtesies of fools are wasted.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> A fool’s gift will profit you nothing,<br/>
<span class="indented">for his eyes are many instead of one.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> He will give little, and upbraid much.<br/>
<span class="indented">He will open his mouth like a crier.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Today he will lend,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and tomorrow he will ask it back.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Such a one is hateful to the Lord and man.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> A fool will say, “I have no friend.<br/>
<span class="indented">I have no thanks for all my good deeds.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Those who eat my bread speak evil of me.”</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> How often, and how many will he be laughed at!<br/>
<span class="indented">For he doesn’t know aright what it is to have.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Even everything is not enough for him.<br/>
<span class="indented">He will be filled with his own foolish ways.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> A slip on the pavement is better than a slip with the tongue.<br/>
<span class="indented">So the downfall of the wicked will come speedily.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> An ungracious man is like a foolish story,<br/>
<span class="indented">frequently told out of a fool’s mouth.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> A parable from the mouth of a fool will be rejected,<br/>
<span class="indented">for he doesn’t speak it in its proper time.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> There is one who is hindered from sinning through lack,<br/>
<span class="indented">and in such a case he will not be troubled.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> Another man may destroy his life through shame;<br/>
<span class="indented">and he destroys it through lack of foolish boldness.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> He who promises to a friend for a favor,<br/>
<span class="indented">and gains him as an enemy for nothing,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">is a bad debtor.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> A lie is a foul blot in a man.<br/>
<span class="indented">It will be continually in the mouth of the ignorant.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> A thief is better than a man who is used to lying,<br/>
<span class="indented">but they both will inherit destruction.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> The ways of those who are godly will not fail,<br/>
<span class="indented">but a sinner will stumble in wickedness.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> He who talks foolishly is hateful.<br/>
<span class="indented">He will be lacking in every way.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> A wise man will advance himself by his words,<br/>
<span class="indented">and one who is prudent will please great men.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> He who tills his land will raise his harvest high.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who pleases great men will obtain pardon for iniquity.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> Presents and gifts blind the eyes of the wise,<br/>
<span class="indented">and like a muzzle on the mouth, they turn away reproofs.</span><br/>
<sup>31</sup> Hidden wisdom and a treasure not seen—<br/>
<span class="indented">what profit is in them both?</span><br/>
<sup>32</sup> Better is he who hides his folly<br/>
<span class="indented">than he who hides his wisdom.</span><br/>
<sup>33</sup> Cherish a shame that is saving<br/>
<span class="indented">rather than a shame which brings sin.</span><br/>
<sup>34</sup> There is one who keeps silent because he has no answer to give;<br/>
<span class="indented">and there is one who keeps silent, knowing his time.</span><br/>
<sup>35</sup> A wise man will keep silent until the right moment,<br/>
<span class="indented">but a braggart and fool goes beyond the right moment.</span> </p></section>

<h2>Day 21</h2>
<!-- Psalms 57, 58, 59 -->
<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 57</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Be merciful to me, God, be merciful to me,<br/>
<span class="indented">for my soul takes refuge in you.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Yes, in the shadow of your wings, I will take refuge,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">until disaster has passed.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> I cry out to God Most High,<br/>
<span class="indented">to God who accomplishes my requests for me.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> He will send from heaven, and save me,<br/>
<span class="indented">he rebukes the one who is pursuing me.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">God will send out his loving kindness and his truth.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> My soul is among lions.<br/>
<span class="indented">I lie among those who devour men,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">whose teeth are spears and arrows,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and their tongue a sharp sword.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Be exalted, God, above the heavens!<br/>
<span class="indented">Let your glory be above all the earth!</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> They have prepared a net for my steps.<br/>
<span class="indented">My soul is bowed down.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">They dig a pit before me.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">They fall into the middle of it themselves.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> My heart is steadfast, God, my heart is steadfast.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will sing, yes, I will sing praises.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Wake up, my glory! Wake up, lute and harp!<br/>
<span class="indented">I will wake up the dawn.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> I will give thanks to you, Lord, among the peoples.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will sing praises to you among the nations.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> For your great loving kindness reaches to the heavens,<br/>
<span class="indented">and your truth to the skies.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Be exalted, God, above the heavens.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let your glory be above all the earth.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 58</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Do you indeed speak righteousness, silent ones?<br/>
<span class="indented">Do you judge blamelessly, you sons of men?</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> No, in your heart you plot injustice.<br/>
<span class="indented">You weigh out the violence of your hands in the earth.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> The wicked go astray from the womb.<br/>
<span class="indented">They are wayward as soon as they are born, speaking lies.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Their poison is like the poison of a snake;<br/>
<span class="indented">like a deaf cobra that stops its ear,</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> which doesn’t listen to the voice of charmers,<br/>
<span class="indented">no matter how skillful the charmer may be.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Break their teeth, God, in their mouth.<br/>
<span class="indented">Break out the great teeth of the young lions, Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Let them vanish like water that flows away.<br/>
<span class="indented">When they draw the bow, let their arrows be made blunt.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Let them be like a snail which melts and passes away,<br/>
<span class="indented">like the stillborn child, who has not seen the sun.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns,<br/>
<span class="indented">he will sweep away the green and the burning alike.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance.<br/>
<span class="indented">He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> So that men shall say, “Most certainly there is a reward for the righteous.<br/>
<span class="indented">Most certainly there is a God who judges the earth.”</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 59</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Deliver me from my enemies, my God.<br/>
<span class="indented">Set me on high from those who rise up against me.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Deliver me from the workers of iniquity.<br/>
<span class="indented">Save me from the bloodthirsty men.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> For, behold, they lie in wait for my soul.<br/>
<span class="indented">The mighty gather themselves together against me,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">not for my disobedience, nor for my sin, Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> I have done no wrong, yet they are ready to attack me.<br/>
<span class="indented">Rise up, behold, and help me!</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> You, Lord God of Armies, the God of Israel,<br/>
<span class="indented">rouse yourself to punish the nations.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Show no mercy to the wicked traitors.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> They return at evening, howling like dogs,<br/>
<span class="indented">and prowl around the city.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Behold, they spew with their mouth.<br/>
<span class="indented">Swords are in their lips, “For,” they say, “who hears us?”</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> But you, Lord, laugh at them.<br/>
<span class="indented">You scoff at all the nations.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Oh, my Strength, I watch for you,<br/>
<span class="indented">for God is my high tower.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> My God will go before me with his loving kindness.<br/>
<span class="indented">God will let me look at my enemies in triumph.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Don’t kill them, or my people may forget.<br/>
<span class="indented">Scatter them by your power, and bring them down, Lord our shield.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> For the sin of their mouth, and the words of their lips,<br/>
<span class="indented">let them be caught in their pride,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for the curses and lies which they utter.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Consume them in wrath.<br/>
<span class="indented">Consume them, and they will be no more.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Let them know that God rules in Jacob,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">to the ends of the earth.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> At evening let them return.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let them howl like a dog, and go around the city.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> They shall wander up and down for food,<br/>
<span class="indented">and wait all night if they aren’t satisfied.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> But I will sing of your strength.<br/>
<span class="indented">Yes, I will sing aloud of your loving kindness in the morning.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">For you have been my high tower,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">a refuge in the day of my distress.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> To you, my strength, I will sing praises.<br/>
<span class="indented">For God is my high tower, the God of my mercy.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 12:1–14 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 12:1–14</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Whoever loves correction loves knowledge,<br/>
<span class="indented">but he who hates reproof is stupid.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> A good man shall obtain favor from the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">but he will condemn a man of wicked plans.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> A man shall not be established by wickedness,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the root of the righteous shall not be moved.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> A worthy woman is the crown of her husband,<br/>
<span class="indented">but a disgraceful wife is as rottenness in his bones.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> The thoughts of the righteous are just,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the advice of the wicked is deceitful.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> The words of the wicked are about lying in wait for blood,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the speech of the upright rescues them.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> The wicked are overthrown, and are no more,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the house of the righteous shall stand.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> A man shall be commended according to his wisdom,<br/>
<span class="indented">but he who has a warped mind shall be despised.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Better is he who is little known and has a servant,<br/>
<span class="indented">than he who honors himself and lacks bread.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> A righteous man respects the life of his animal,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> He who tills his land shall have plenty of bread,<br/>
<span class="indented">but he who chases fantasies is void of understanding.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> The wicked desires the plunder of evil men,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the root of the righteous flourishes.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> An evil man is trapped by sinfulness of lips,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the righteous shall come out of trouble.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth.<br/>
<span class="indented">The doings of a man’s hands shall be rewarded to him.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 21 -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 21</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> My son, have you sinned? Don’t add more.<br/>
<span class="indented">Pray for forgiveness for your past sins.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Flee from sin as from the face of a serpent;<br/>
<span class="indented">for if you come too near it, it will bite you.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">The teeth of it are like the teeth of a lion,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">slaying the souls of men.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> All iniquity is like a two-edged sword.<br/>
<span class="indented">Its wound can’t be healed.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Terror and violence will waste riches.<br/>
<span class="indented">So the house of a proud man will be laid waste.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> The prayer of a poor man goes from his mouth to the Lord’s ears,<br/>
<span class="indented">and his judgment comes speedily.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> One who hates reproof is in the path of the sinner,<br/>
<span class="indented">but he who fears the Lord will repent in his heart.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> He who is mighty in tongue is known from afar.<br/>
<span class="indented">A sensible man knows when he slips.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> He who builds his house with other men’s money is like one who gathers stones for his own tomb.<br/>
<sup>9</sup> The congregation of wicked men is like a heap of tow wrapped together.<br/>
<span class="indented">Their end is a flame of fire.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> The way of sinners is made smooth with stones,<br/>
<span class="indented">but at its end is the pit of Hades.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> He who keeps the law becomes master of its intent.<br/>
<span class="indented">The fear of the Lord brings wisdom.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> He who is not clever will not be taught,<br/>
<span class="indented">but there is a cleverness which multiplies bitterness.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> The knowledge of a wise man will be made abundant like a flood,<br/>
<span class="indented">and his counsel is like a spring of life.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> The inner parts of a fool are like a broken vessel.<br/>
<span class="indented">He will hold no knowledge.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> If an understanding man hears a wise word, he will commend it,<br/>
<span class="indented">and add to it.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">The self-indulgent hears it, and it displeases him,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and he throws it behind his back.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> The talking of a fool is like a burden in the way,<br/>
<span class="indented">but grace will be found on the lips of the wise.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> The mouth of the prudent man will be sought in the congregation.<br/>
<span class="indented">They will ponder his words in their heart.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> As a house that is destroyed, so is wisdom to a fool.<br/>
<span class="indented">The knowledge of the unwise is words without sense.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> Instruction is like chains of gold on the feet of an understanding man,<br/>
<span class="indented">and like manacles on his right hand.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> A fool lifts up his voice with laughter,<br/>
<span class="indented">but a clever man smiles quietly.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> Instruction is to a prudent man like a golden ornament,<br/>
<span class="indented">and like a bracelet on the right arm.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> The foot of a fool rushes into a house,<br/>
<span class="indented">but a man of experience stands respectfully outside.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> A boor peeps through the door into the house,<br/>
<span class="indented">but a courteous man stands outside.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> It is rude for a man to listen at the door,<br/>
<span class="indented">and a man of prudence will be grieved by the disgrace.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> The lips of strangers will speak of these things;<br/>
<span class="indented">but the words of the prudent will be weighed in the balance.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> The heart of fools is in their mouth;<br/>
<span class="indented">but the mouth of wise men is their heart.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> When the ungodly curses Satan, he curses his own soul.<br/>
<sup>28</sup> A whisperer defiles his own soul,<br/>
<span class="indented">and will be hated wherever he travels.</span> </p></section>

<h2>Day 22</h2>
<!-- Psalms 60, 61, 62, 63 -->
<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 60</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> God, you have rejected us. You have broken us down.<br/>
<span class="indented">You have been angry. Restore us, again.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> You have made the land tremble. You have torn it.<br/>
<span class="indented">Mend its fractures, for it quakes.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> You have shown your people hard things.<br/>
<span class="indented">You have made us drink the wine that makes us stagger.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> You have given a banner to those who fear you,<br/>
<span class="indented">that it may be displayed because of the truth.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> So that your beloved may be delivered,<br/>
<span class="indented">save with your right hand, and answer us.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> God has spoken from his sanctuary:<br/>
<span class="indented">“I will triumph.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I will divide Shechem,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and measure out the valley of Succoth.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine.<br/>
<span class="indented">Ephraim also is the defense of my head.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Judah is my scepter.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Moab is my wash pot.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will toss my sandal on Edom.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I will shout in triumph over Philistia.”</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Who will bring me into the strong city?<br/>
<span class="indented">Who has led me to Edom?</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Haven’t you, God, rejected us?<br/>
<span class="indented">You don’t go out with our armies, God.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Give us help against the adversary,<br/>
<span class="indented">for the help of man is vain.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Through God we will do valiantly,<br/>
<span class="indented">for it is he who will tread down our adversaries.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 61</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Hear my cry, God.<br/>
<span class="indented">Listen to my prayer.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> From the end of the earth, I will call to you when my heart is overwhelmed.<br/>
<span class="indented">Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> For you have been a refuge for me,<br/>
<span class="indented">a strong tower from the enemy.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> I will dwell in your tent forever.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will take refuge in the shelter of your wings.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> For you, God, have heard my vows.<br/>
<span class="indented">You have given me the heritage of those who fear your name.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> You will prolong the king’s life.<br/>
<span class="indented">His years will be for generations.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> He shall be enthroned in God’s presence forever.<br/>
<span class="indented">Appoint your loving kindness and truth, that they may preserve him.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> So I will sing praise to your name forever,<br/>
<span class="indented">that I may fulfill my vows daily.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 62</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> My soul rests in God alone.<br/>
<span class="indented">My salvation is from him.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> He alone is my rock and my salvation—my fortress.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will never be greatly shaken.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> How long will you assault a man?<br/>
<span class="indented">Would all of you throw him down,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence?</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> They fully intend to topple him from his lofty place.<br/>
<span class="indented">They delight in lies.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> My soul, wait in silence for God alone,<br/>
<span class="indented">for my expectation is from him.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> He alone is my rock and my salvation—my fortress.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will not be shaken.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> My salvation and my honor is with God.<br/>
<span class="indented">The rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Trust in him at all times, you people.<br/>
<span class="indented">Pour out your heart before him.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">God is a refuge for us.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Surely men of low degree are just a breath,<br/>
<span class="indented">and men of high degree are a lie.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">In the balances they will go up.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">They are together lighter than a breath.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Don’t trust in oppression.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t become vain in robbery.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">If riches increase,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">don’t set your heart on them.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> God has spoken once;<br/>
<span class="indented">twice I have heard this,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">that power belongs to God.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Also to you, Lord, belongs loving kindness,<br/>
<span class="indented">for you reward every man according to his work.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 63</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> God, you are my God. I will earnestly seek you.<br/>
<span class="indented">My soul thirsts for you.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">My flesh longs for you,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">in a dry and weary land, where there is no water.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> So I have seen you in the sanctuary,<br/>
<span class="indented">watching your power and your glory.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Because your loving kindness is better than life,<br/>
<span class="indented">my lips shall praise you.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> So I will bless you while I live.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will lift up my hands in your name.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> My soul shall be satisfied as with the richest food.<br/>
<span class="indented">My mouth shall praise you with joyful lips,</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> when I remember you on my bed,<br/>
<span class="indented">and think about you in the night watches.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> For you have been my help.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will rejoice in the shadow of your wings.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> My soul stays close to you.<br/>
<span class="indented">Your right hand holds me up.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> But those who seek my soul to destroy it<br/>
<span class="indented">shall go into the lower parts of the earth.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> They shall be given over to the power of the sword.<br/>
<span class="indented">They shall be jackal food.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> But the king shall rejoice in God.<br/>
<span class="indented">Everyone who swears by him will praise him,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for the mouth of those who speak lies shall be silenced.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 12:15–28 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 12:15–28</h4>
<p>
<sup>15</sup> The way of a fool is right in his own eyes,<br/>
<span class="indented">but he who is wise listens to counsel.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> A fool shows his annoyance the same day,<br/>
<span class="indented">but one who overlooks an insult is prudent.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> He who is truthful testifies honestly,<br/>
<span class="indented">but a false witness lies.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> There is one who speaks rashly like the piercing of a sword,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the tongue of the wise heals.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> Truth’s lips will be established forever,<br/>
<span class="indented">but a lying tongue is only momentary.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> Deceit is in the heart of those who plot evil,<br/>
<span class="indented">but joy comes to the promoters of peace.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> No mischief shall happen to the righteous,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the wicked shall be filled with evil.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">but those who do the truth are his delight.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> A prudent man keeps his knowledge,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the hearts of fools proclaim foolishness.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> The hands of the diligent shall rule,<br/>
<span class="indented">but laziness ends in slave labor.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> Anxiety in a man’s heart weighs it down,<br/>
<span class="indented">but a kind word makes it glad.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> A righteous person is cautious in friendship,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the way of the wicked leads them astray.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> The slothful man doesn’t roast his game,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the possessions of diligent men are prized.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> In the way of righteousness is life;<br/>
<span class="indented">in its path there is no death.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 22 -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 22</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> A slothful man is compared to a filthy stone,<br/>
<span class="indented">and everyone hisses him out to his disgrace.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> A slothful man is compared to the filth of a dunghill.<br/>
<span class="indented">Every man who picks it up will shake it out of his hand.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> An evil-nurtured son is the dishonor of his father,<br/>
<span class="indented">and a foolish daughter is born to his loss.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> A prudent daughter will inherit a husband of her own;<br/>
<span class="indented">but she who brings shame is a grief to the one who bore her.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> A shameless woman will be counted as a dog,<br/>
<span class="indented">but she who is shamefaced will fear the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> A woman who honors her husband will appear wise to all,<br/>
<span class="indented">but one who dishonors her husband in her pride will be known to all.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">All men shall condemn her.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Indolence leads to decay, and slackness to lowering of the roof.<br/>
<sup>8</sup> The gathering of stories is like a burden upon the foolish man’s back.<br/>
<sup>9</sup> An instructor of fools is like one who glues broken pottery together,<br/>
<span class="indented">or like one who wakes someone out of a deep sleep.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> He who tells a story to a fool tells it to a drowsy man.<br/>
<span class="indented">In the end, he will say, “What is it?”</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Weep for the dead, for light has failed him;<br/>
<span class="indented">and weep for a fool, for understanding has failed him.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Weep more sweetly for the dead, because he has found rest;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">but the life of the fool is worse than death.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Mourning for the dead lasts seven days;<br/>
<span class="indented">but for a fool or an ungodly man, all the days of his life.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Don’t talk much with a foolish man,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t go to one who has no understanding.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Beware of him, lest you have trouble</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and be defiled when he shakes himself.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Stay away from him, and you will find rest,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and won’t be wearied by his madness.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> What would be heavier than lead?<br/>
<span class="indented">And what is its name but “fool”?</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Sand, salt, and a mass of iron are easier to bear<br/>
<span class="indented">than a man without understanding.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> A wooden beam bound together in a building will not be dissolved by an earthquake;<br/>
<span class="indented">so a heart established in trained thought will not be afraid in a crisis.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> A heart settled on intelligent thought is as a stucco decoration on a polished wall.<br/>
<sup>18</sup> Piles of gravel placed on a high place will not endure against the wind;<br/>
<span class="indented">so a fearful heart in the imagination of a fool will not stand against any fear.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> He who pricks the eye will make tears fall;<br/>
<span class="indented">and he who pricks the heart makes it show feeling.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> Whoever throws a stone at birds scares them away;<br/>
<span class="indented">and he who upbraids a friend will dissolve friendship.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> If you have drawn a sword against your friend, don’t despair;<br/>
<span class="indented">for there may be a way back.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> If you have opened your mouth against your friend, don’t be afraid;<br/>
<span class="indented">for there may be reconciliation—unless it be for insulting or arrogance or disclosing a secret or a treacherous blow.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">In these cases, any friend will flee.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Gain trust with your neighbor in his poverty,<br/>
<span class="indented">that in his prosperity you may be full of his good things.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Stand by him in the time of his affliction,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">that you may be an heir with him in his inheritance.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> The vapor and smoke of the furnace precede the fire;<br/>
<span class="indented">so insults precede bloodshed.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> I will not be ashamed to shelter a friend;<br/>
<span class="indented">I won’t hide myself from his face.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> If any evil happens to me because of him,<br/>
<span class="indented">everyone who hears it will beware of him.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> Who will set a guard over my mouth<br/>
<span class="indented">and put a seal of shrewdness on my lips,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">that I don’t fall from it,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and that my tongue doesn’t destroy me?</span> </p></section>

<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 64</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Hear my voice, God, in my complaint.<br/>
<span class="indented">Preserve my life from fear of the enemy.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked,<br/>
<span class="indented">from the noisy crowd of the ones doing evil;</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> who sharpen their tongue like a sword,<br/>
<span class="indented">and aim their arrows, deadly words,</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> to shoot innocent men from ambushes.<br/>
<span class="indented">They shoot at him suddenly and fearlessly.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> They encourage themselves in evil plans.<br/>
<span class="indented">They talk about laying snares secretly.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">They say, “Who will see them?”</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> They plot injustice, saying, “We have made a perfect plan!”<br/>
<span class="indented">Surely man’s mind and heart are cunning.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> But God will shoot at them.<br/>
<span class="indented">They will be suddenly struck down with an arrow.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Their own tongues shall ruin them.<br/>
<span class="indented">All who see them will shake their heads.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> All mankind shall be afraid.<br/>
<span class="indented">They shall declare the work of God,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and shall wisely ponder what he has done.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> The righteous shall be glad in the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">and shall take refuge in him.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">All the upright in heart shall praise him!</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 65</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Praise waits for you, God, in Zion.<br/>
<span class="indented">Vows shall be performed to you.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> You who hear prayer,<br/>
<span class="indented">all men will come to you.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Sins overwhelmed me,<br/>
<span class="indented">but you atoned for our transgressions.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Blessed is the one whom you choose and cause to come near,<br/>
<span class="indented">that he may live in your courts.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">We will be filled with the goodness of your house,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">your holy temple.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> By awesome deeds of righteousness, you answer us,<br/>
<span class="indented">God of our salvation.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">You who are the hope of all the ends of the earth,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">of those who are far away on the sea.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> By your power, you form the mountains,<br/>
<span class="indented">having armed yourself with strength.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> You still the roaring of the seas,<br/>
<span class="indented">the roaring of their waves,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and the turmoil of the nations.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> They also who dwell in far-away places are afraid at your wonders.<br/>
<span class="indented">You call the morning’s dawn and the evening with songs of joy.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> You visit the earth and water it.<br/>
<span class="indented">You greatly enrich it.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">The river of God is full of water.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">You provide them grain, for so you have ordained it.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> You drench its furrows.<br/>
<span class="indented">You level its ridges.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">You soften it with showers.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">You bless it with a crop.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> You crown the year with your bounty.<br/>
<span class="indented">Your carts overflow with abundance.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> The wilderness grasslands overflow.<br/>
<span class="indented">The hills are clothed with gladness.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> The pastures are covered with flocks.<br/>
<span class="indented">The valleys also are clothed with grain.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">They shout for joy!</span><br/>
<span class="indented">They also sing.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 66</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Make a joyful shout to God, all the earth!<br/>
<sup>2</sup> Sing to the glory of his name!<br/>
<span class="indented">Offer glory and praise!</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Tell God, “How awesome are your deeds!<br/>
<span class="indented">Through the greatness of your power, your enemies submit themselves to you.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> All the earth will worship you,<br/>
<span class="indented">and will sing to you;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">they will sing to your name.”</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Come, and see God’s deeds—<br/>
<span class="indented">awesome work on behalf of the children of men.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> He turned the sea into dry land.<br/>
<span class="indented">They went through the river on foot.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">There, we rejoiced in him.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> He rules by his might forever.<br/>
<span class="indented">His eyes watch the nations.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t let the rebellious rise up against him.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Oh bless our God, you peoples!<br/>
<span class="indented">Make the sound of his praise heard,</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> who preserves our life among the living,<br/>
<span class="indented">and doesn’t allow our feet to be moved.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> For you, God, have tested us.<br/>
<span class="indented">You have refined us, as silver is refined.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> You brought us into prison.<br/>
<span class="indented">You laid a burden on our backs.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> You allowed men to ride over our heads.<br/>
<span class="indented">We went through fire and through water,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">but you brought us to the place of abundance.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> I will come into your temple with burnt offerings.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will pay my vows to you,</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> which my lips promised,<br/>
<span class="indented">and my mouth spoke, when I was in distress.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> I will offer to you burnt offerings of fat animals,<br/>
<span class="indented">with the offering of rams.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I will offer bulls with goats.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Come and hear, all you who fear God.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will declare what he has done for my soul.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> I cried to him with my mouth.<br/>
<span class="indented">He was extolled with my tongue.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> If I cherished sin in my heart,<br/>
<span class="indented">the Lord wouldn’t have listened.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> But most certainly, God has listened.<br/>
<span class="indented">He has heard the voice of my prayer.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> Blessed be God, who has not turned away my prayer,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor his loving kindness from me.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 13:1–13 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 13:1–13</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> A wise son listens to his father’s instruction,<br/>
<span class="indented">but a scoffer doesn’t listen to rebuke.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> By the fruit of his lips, a man enjoys good things,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the unfaithful crave violence.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> He who guards his mouth guards his soul.<br/>
<span class="indented">One who opens wide his lips comes to ruin.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> The soul of the sluggard desires, and has nothing,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the desire of the diligent shall be fully satisfied.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> A righteous man hates lies,<br/>
<span class="indented">but a wicked man is loathsome, and comes to shame.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Righteousness guards the way of integrity,<br/>
<span class="indented">but wickedness overthrows the sinner.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> There are some who pretend to be rich, yet have nothing.<br/>
<span class="indented">There are some who pretend to be poor, yet have great wealth.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> The ransom of a man’s life is his riches,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the poor hear no threats.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> The light of the righteous shines brightly,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the lamp of the wicked is snuffed out.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Pride only breeds quarrels,<br/>
<span class="indented">but with ones who take advice is wisdom.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Wealth gained dishonestly dwindles away,<br/>
<span class="indented">but he who gathers by hand makes it grow.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Hope deferred makes the heart sick,<br/>
<span class="indented">but when longing is fulfilled, it is a tree of life.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Whoever despises instruction will pay for it,<br/>
<span class="indented">but he who respects a command will be rewarded.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 23 -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 23</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> O Lord, Father and Master of my life,<br/>
<span class="indented">don’t give me a proud look,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">but turn away impure thoughts from me.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Let neither lust nor desires take hold of me;<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t give over me to a shameless soul.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> O Lord, Father, and God of my life,<br/>
<span class="indented">don’t give me a proud look.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Turn away from me vain hopes and lustful desires.<br/>
<span class="indented">Hold me back from gluttony,</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> and don’t let me fall by it.<br/>
<sup>6</sup> Listen, my children, to the discipline of my mouth.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who keeps it will not be taken.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> The sinner will be overtaken through his lips,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the insulter and the proud man will fall by them.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Don’t let your mouth get used to making oaths,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t habitually mention the holy name.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> For as a servant who is often scourged can’t lack a bruise,<br/>
<span class="indented">so he also who swears and utters the Name continually will not be blameless.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> A man of many oaths will be filled with lawlessness,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the scourge will not depart from his house.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">If he offends, his sin will be on him.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">If he disregards it, he has sinned doubly.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">If he has sworn in vain, he will not be justified,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for his house will be filled with calamities.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> There is a way of speaking comparable to death.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let it not be found in the heritage of Jacob,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for all these things will be far from the godly,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and they will not wallow in sins.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Don’t accustom your mouth to lewd expressions;<br/>
<span class="indented">for in it, there is the sin of a word.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Remember your father and mother<br/>
<span class="indented">when you sit among great men.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t forget yourself before them,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and become a fool by habit.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Then you wish that you had not been born,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and curse the day of your nativity.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> A man who is accustomed to words of reproach<br/>
<span class="indented">will never be corrected all the days of his life.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Two sorts of men multiply sins,<br/>
<span class="indented">and a third will bring wrath:</span><br/>
<span class="indented">a hot mind like a burning fire will not be quenched until it is consumed;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">a fornicator in the body of his flesh will never cease until he has burned out the fire.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> All bread is sweet to a fornicator.<br/>
<span class="indented">He will not cease until he dies.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> A man who goes astray from his bed says in his heart,<br/>
<span class="indented">“Who sees me?</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Darkness is around me, and the walls hide me.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">No one sees me. Of whom am I afraid?</span><br/>
<span class="indented">The Most High will not remember my sins.”</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> The eyes of men are his fear.<br/>
<span class="indented">He doesn’t know that the eyes of the Lord are ten thousand times brighter than the sun,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">seeing all the ways of men,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and looking into hidden places.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> All things were known to him before they were created.<br/>
<span class="indented">So they were also after they were perfected.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> This man will be punished in the streets of the city.<br/>
<span class="indented">He will be seized where he didn’t think of.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> So it is with a wife who leaves her husband,<br/>
<span class="indented">and brings in an heir by a stranger.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> For first, she was disobedient to the law of the Most High.<br/>
<span class="indented">Secondly, she trespassed against her own husband.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Thirdly, she played the adulteress in whoredom,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and brought children by another man.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> She will be brought out into the assembly,<br/>
<span class="indented">and punishment will fall on her children.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> Her children will not take root.<br/>
<span class="indented">Her branches will not bear fruit.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> She will leave her memory for a curse.<br/>
<span class="indented">Her reproach will not be blotted out.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> Those who are left will know that there is nothing better than the fear of the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">and nothing sweeter than to take heed to the commandments of the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> It is great glory to follow the Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">Length of days will be received from him.</span> </p></section>

<sup>7</sup> God will bless us.<br/>
<span class="indented">All the ends of the earth shall fear him.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 68</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Let God arise! Let his enemies be scattered!<br/>
<span class="indented">Let them who hate him also flee before him.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> As smoke is driven away, so drive them away.<br/>
<span class="indented">As wax melts before the fire,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> But let the righteous be glad.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let them rejoice before God.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Yes, let them rejoice with gladness.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Sing to God! Sing praises to his name!<br/>
<span class="indented">Extol him who rides on the clouds—his name is the Lord!</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Rejoice before him.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> A father of the fatherless, and a defender of widows,<br/>
<span class="indented">is God in his holy habitation.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> God sets the lonely in families.<br/>
<span class="indented">He brings out the prisoners with singing,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">but the rebellious dwell in a sun-scorched land.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> God, when you went out before your people,<br/>
<span class="indented">when you marched through the wilderness...</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> The earth trembled.<br/>
<span class="indented">The sky also poured down rain at the presence of the God of Sinai—</span><br/>
<span class="indented">at the presence of God, the God of Israel.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> You, God, sent a plentiful rain.<br/>
<span class="indented">You confirmed your inheritance when it was weary.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Your congregation lived therein.<br/>
<span class="indented">You, God, prepared your goodness for the poor.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> The Lord announced the word.<br/>
<span class="indented">The ones who proclaim it are a great company.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> “Kings of armies flee! They flee!”<br/>
<span class="indented">She who waits at home divides the plunder,</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> while you sleep among the camp fires,<br/>
<span class="indented">the wings of a dove sheathed with silver,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">her feathers with shining gold.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> When the Almighty scattered kings in her,<br/>
<span class="indented">it snowed on Zalmon.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> The mountains of Bashan are majestic mountains.<br/>
<span class="indented">The mountains of Bashan are rugged.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Why do you look in envy, you rugged mountains,<br/>
<span class="indented">at the mountain where God chooses to reign?</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Yes, the Lord will dwell there forever.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> The chariots of God are tens of thousands and thousands of thousands.<br/>
<span class="indented">The Lord is among them, from Sinai, into the sanctuary.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> You have ascended on high.<br/>
<span class="indented">You have led away captives.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">You have received gifts among men,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">yes, among the rebellious also, that the Lord God might dwell there.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears our burdens,<br/>
<span class="indented">the God of our salvation.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> God is to us a God of deliverance.<br/>
<span class="indented">To the Lord, the Lord, belongs escape from death.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> But God will strike through the head of his enemies,<br/>
<span class="indented">the hairy scalp of such a one as still continues in his guiltiness.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> The Lord said, “I will bring you again from Bashan.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will bring you again from the depths of the sea,</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> that you may crush them, dipping your foot in blood,<br/>
<span class="indented">that the tongues of your dogs may have their portion from your enemies.”</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> They have seen your processions, God,<br/>
<span class="indented">even the processions of my God, my King, into the sanctuary.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> The singers went before, the minstrels followed after,<br/>
<span class="indented">among the ladies playing with tambourines.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> “Bless God in the congregations,<br/>
<span class="indented">even the Lord in the assembly of Israel!”</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> There is little Benjamin, their ruler,<br/>
<span class="indented">the princes of Judah, their council,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> Your God has commanded your strength.<br/>
<span class="indented">Strengthen, God, that which you have done for us.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> Because of your temple at Jerusalem,<br/>
<span class="indented">kings shall bring presents to you.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> Rebuke the wild animal of the reeds,<br/>
<span class="indented">the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the peoples.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Trample under foot the bars of silver.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He has scattered the nations that delight in war.</span><br/>
<sup>31</sup> Princes shall come out of Egypt.<br/>
<span class="indented">Ethiopia shall hurry to stretch out her hands to God.</span><br/>
<sup>32</sup> Sing to God, you kingdoms of the earth!<br/>
<span class="indented">Sing praises to the Lord!</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>33</sup> To him who rides on the heaven of heavens, which are of old;<br/>
<span class="indented">behold, he utters his voice, a mighty voice.</span><br/>
<sup>34</sup> Ascribe strength to God!<br/>
<span class="indented">His excellency is over Israel,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">his strength is in the skies.</span><br/>
<sup>35</sup> You are awesome, God, in your sanctuaries.<br/>
<span class="indented">The God of Israel gives strength and power to his people.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Praise be to God!</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 13:14–25 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 13:14–25</h4>
<p>
<sup>14</sup> The teaching of the wise is a spring of life,<br/>
<span class="indented">to turn from the snares of death.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Good understanding wins favor,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the way of the unfaithful is hard.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Every prudent man acts from knowledge,<br/>
<span class="indented">but a fool exposes folly.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> A wicked messenger falls into trouble,<br/>
<span class="indented">but a trustworthy envoy gains healing.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> Poverty and shame come to him who refuses discipline,<br/>
<span class="indented">but he who heeds correction shall be honored.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> Longing fulfilled is sweet to the soul,<br/>
<span class="indented">but fools detest turning from evil.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> One who walks with wise men grows wise,<br/>
<span class="indented">but a companion of fools suffers harm.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> Misfortune pursues sinners,<br/>
<span class="indented">but prosperity rewards the righteous.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s children,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the wealth of the sinner is stored for the righteous.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> An abundance of food is in poor people’s fields,<br/>
<span class="indented">but injustice sweeps it away.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> One who spares the rod hates his son,<br/>
<span class="indented">but one who loves him is careful to discipline him.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> The righteous one eats to the satisfying of his soul,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the belly of the wicked goes hungry.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 24:1–17 -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 24:1–17</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Wisdom will praise herself,<br/>
<span class="indented">and will glory in the midst of her people.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> In the assembly of the Most High, she will open her mouth,<br/>
<span class="indented">and glorify herself in the presence of his power:</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> “I came out of the mouth of the Most High,<br/>
<span class="indented">and covered the earth like a mist.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> I lived in high places,<br/>
<span class="indented">and my throne is in a pillar of cloud.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Alone I have made the circuit of the sky,<br/>
<span class="indented">and walked in the depth of the abyss.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> In the waves of the sea, in all the earth,<br/>
<span class="indented">and in every people and nation, I have gotten a possession.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> With all these, I sought rest.<br/>
<span class="indented">In whose inheritance shall I lodge?</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Then the Creator of all things gave me a command.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who created me made my tent to rest,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and said, ‘Let your dwelling be in Jacob,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and your inheritance in Israel.’</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> He created me from the beginning before the world,<br/>
<span class="indented">and I will never cease.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> In the holy tabernacle, I served before him.<br/>
<span class="indented">So I was established in Zion.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> In the beloved city, he gave me rest.<br/>
<span class="indented">In Jerusalem was my authority.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> I took root in a glorified people,<br/>
<span class="indented">in the portion of the Lord who is their inheritance.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> I was exalted like a cedar in Lebanon,<br/>
<span class="indented">and like a cypress on the mountains of Hermon.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> I was exalted like a palm tree on the sea shore,<br/>
<span class="indented">and as rose plants in Jericho,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and as a fair olive tree in the plain.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I was exalted as a plane tree.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> I gave a pleasant fragrance like cinnamon and aspalathus.<br/>
<span class="indented">I yielded a scent like the best myrrh,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">like galbanum, onyx, and sweet storax,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and as the smoke of frankincense in the tent.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> I spread out my branches like a terebinth.<br/>
<span class="indented">My branches are glorious and graceful.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> I am like a vine bud, and my blossoms are the fruit of honor and riches.

<!-- Psalms 69 -->
<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 69</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Save me, God,<br/>
<span class="indented">for the waters have come up to my neck!</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> I sink in deep mire, where there is no foothold.<br/>
<span class="indented">I have come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> I am weary with my crying. My throat is dry.<br/>
<span class="indented">My eyes fail looking for my God.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head.<br/>
<span class="indented">Those who want to cut me off, being my enemies wrongfully, are mighty.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I have to restore what I didn’t take away.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> God, you know my foolishness.<br/>
<span class="indented">My sins aren’t hidden from you.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Don’t let those who wait for you be shamed through me, Lord God of Armies.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t let those who seek you be brought to dishonor through me, God of Israel.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Because for your sake, I have borne reproach.<br/>
<span class="indented">Shame has covered my face.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> I have become a stranger to my brothers,<br/>
<span class="indented">an alien to my mother’s children.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> For the zeal of your house consumes me.<br/>
<span class="indented">The reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen on me.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> When I wept and I fasted,<br/>
<span class="indented">that was to my reproach.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> When I made sackcloth my clothing,<br/>
<span class="indented">I became a byword to them.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Those who sit in the gate talk about me.<br/>
<span class="indented">I am the song of the drunkards.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> But as for me, my prayer is to you, Lord, in an acceptable time.<br/>
<span class="indented">God, in the abundance of your loving kindness, answer me in the truth of your salvation.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Deliver me out of the mire, and don’t let me sink.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let me be delivered from those who hate me, and out of the deep waters.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Don’t let the flood waters overwhelm me,<br/>
<span class="indented">neither let the deep swallow me up.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t let the pit shut its mouth on me.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Answer me, Lord, for your loving kindness is good.<br/>
<span class="indented">According to the multitude of your tender mercies, turn to me.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Don’t hide your face from your servant,<br/>
<span class="indented">for I am in distress. Answer me speedily!</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> Draw near to my soul, and redeem it.<br/>
<span class="indented">Ransom me because of my enemies.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> You know my reproach, my shame, and my dishonor.<br/>
<span class="indented">My adversaries are all before you.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> Reproach has broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness.<br/>
<span class="indented">I looked for some to take pity, but there was none;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for comforters, but I found none.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> They also gave me poison for my food.<br/>
<span class="indented">In my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> Let their table before them become a snare.<br/>
<span class="indented">May it become a retribution and a trap.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Let their eyes be darkened, so that they can’t see.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let their backs be continually bent.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> Pour out your indignation on them.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let the fierceness of your anger overtake them.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> Let their habitation be desolate.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let no one dwell in their tents.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> For they persecute him whom you have wounded.<br/>
<span class="indented">They tell of the sorrow of those whom you have hurt.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> Charge them with crime upon crime.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t let them come into your righteousness.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> Let them be blotted out of the book of life,<br/>
<span class="indented">and not be written with the righteous.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> But I am in pain and distress.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let your salvation, God, protect me.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> I will praise the name of God with a song,<br/>
<span class="indented">and will magnify him with thanksgiving.</span><br/>
<sup>31</sup> It will please the Lord better than an ox,<br/>
<span class="indented">or a bull that has horns and hoofs.</span><br/>
<sup>32</sup> The humble have seen it, and are glad.<br/>
<span class="indented">You who seek after God, let your heart live.</span><br/>
<sup>33</sup> For the Lord hears the needy,<br/>
<span class="indented">and doesn’t despise his captive people.</span><br/>
<sup>34</sup> Let heaven and earth praise him;<br/>
<span class="indented">the seas, and everything that moves in them!</span><br/>
<sup>35</sup> For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah.<br/>
<span class="indented">They shall settle there, and own it.</span><br/>
<sup>36</sup> The children also of his servants shall inherit it.<br/>
<span class="indented">Those who love his name shall dwell in it.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 14:1–18 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 14:1–18</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Every wise woman builds her house,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the foolish one tears it down with her own hands.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> He who walks in his uprightness fears the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">but he who is perverse in his ways despises him.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> The fool’s talk brings a rod to his back,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the lips of the wise protect them.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Where no oxen are, the crib is clean,<br/>
<span class="indented">but much increase is by the strength of the ox.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> A truthful witness will not lie,<br/>
<span class="indented">but a false witness pours out lies.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> A scoffer seeks wisdom, and doesn’t find it,<br/>
<span class="indented">but knowledge comes easily to a discerning person.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Stay away from a foolish man,<br/>
<span class="indented">for you won’t find knowledge on his lips.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> The wisdom of the prudent is to think about his way,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the folly of fools is deceit.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Fools mock at making atonement for sins,<br/>
<span class="indented">but amongst the upright there is good will.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> The heart knows its own bitterness and joy;<br/>
<span class="indented">he will not share these with a stranger.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> The house of the wicked will be overthrown,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the tent of the upright will flourish.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> There is a way which seems right to a man,<br/>
<span class="indented">but in the end it leads to death.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Even in laughter the heart may be sorrowful,<br/>
<span class="indented">and mirth may end in heaviness.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> The unfaithful will be repaid for his own ways;<br/>
<span class="indented">likewise a good man will be rewarded for his ways.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> A simple man believes everything,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the prudent man carefully considers his ways.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> A wise man fears and shuns evil,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the fool is hot headed and reckless.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> He who is quick to become angry will commit folly,<br/>
<span class="indented">and a crafty man is hated.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> The simple inherit folly,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 24:18–34 -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 24:18–34</h4>
<p>
<sup>18</sup> I am the mother of fair love, of fear, of knowledge, and of holy hope.<br/>
<span class="indented">I therefore, being eternal, am given to all my children who are named by him.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> Come to me, all you who desire me,<br/>
<span class="indented">and be filled with my fruits.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> For my memory is sweeter than honey,<br/>
<span class="indented">and my inheritance is sweeter than the honeycomb.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> They who eat me will still be hungry.<br/>
<span class="indented">They who drink me will still be thirsty.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> He who obeys me will not be disappointed.<br/>
<span class="indented">They who work by me will not sin.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> All these things are in the book of the covenant of the Most High God,<br/>
<span class="indented">the law which Moses commanded us for a heritage to the assemblies of Jacob.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> Don’t faint at my presence.<br/>
<span class="indented">Draw near to me, all you who desire me,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and be filled with my fruits.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> For my memorial is sweeter than honey,<br/>
<span class="indented">and my inheritance than the honeycomb.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> My remembrance endures to everlasting generations.<br/>
<sup>27</sup> Those who eat of me will hunger for more.<br/>
<span class="indented">Those who drink of me will thirst for more.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> He who obeys me will not be put to shame,<br/>
<span class="indented">and those who work in me will not sin.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> All these things are the book of the covenant of the Most High God,<br/>
<span class="indented">even the law which Moses commanded for an inheritance to the congregation of Jacob.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> Don’t be fainthearted, but come to him with all your heart.<br/>
<sup>31</sup> Seek and you shall find.<br/>
<span class="indented">Draw near to him, and you shall be filled.</span><br/>
<sup>32</sup> Don’t be unwise in your deeds,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t glory in your own wisdom.</span><br/>
<sup>33</sup> Let the counsel of the Lord dwell in you,<br/>
<span class="indented">for he is mighty,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and he will be honored by all the earth.</span><br/>
<sup>34</sup> Let all who fear the Lord wait on his mercy,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t go aside, lest you fall.</span> </p></section>

<h2>Day 26</h2>
<!-- Psalms 70, 71 -->
<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 70</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Hurry, God, to deliver me.<br/>
<span class="indented">Come quickly to help me, Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Let them be disappointed and confounded who seek my soul.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let those who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Let them be turned because of their shame<br/>
<span class="indented">who say, “Aha! Aha!”</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let those who love your salvation continually say,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">“Let God be exalted!”</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> But I am poor and needy.<br/>
<span class="indented">Come to me quickly, God.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">You are my help and my deliverer.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Lord, don’t delay.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 71</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> In you, Lord, I take refuge.<br/>
<span class="indented">Never let me be disappointed.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Deliver me in your righteousness, and rescue me.<br/>
<span class="indented">Turn your ear to me, and save me.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Be to me a rock of refuge to which I may always go.<br/>
<span class="indented">Give the command to save me,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for you are my rock and my fortress.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Rescue me, my God, from the hand of the wicked,<br/>
<span class="indented">from the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> For you are my hope, Lord God;<br/>
<span class="indented">my confidence from my youth.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> I have relied on you from the womb.<br/>
<span class="indented">You are he who took me out of my mother’s womb.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I will always praise you.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> I am a marvel to many,<br/>
<span class="indented">but you are my strong refuge.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> My mouth shall be filled with your praise,<br/>
<span class="indented">with your honor all day long.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Don’t reject me in my old age.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t forsake me when my strength fails.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> For my enemies talk about me.<br/>
<span class="indented">Those who watch for my soul conspire together,</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> saying, “God has forsaken him.<br/>
<span class="indented">Pursue and take him, for no one will rescue him.”</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> God, don’t be far from me.<br/>
<span class="indented">My God, hurry to help me.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Let my accusers be disappointed and consumed.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let them be covered with disgrace and scorn who want to harm me.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> But I will always hope,<br/>
<span class="indented">and will add to all of your praise.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> My mouth will tell about your righteousness,<br/>
<span class="indented">and of your salvation all day,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">though I don’t know its full measure.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> I will come with the mighty acts of the Lord God.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will make mention of your righteousness, even of yours alone.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> God, you have taught me from my youth.<br/>
<span class="indented">Until now, I have declared your wondrous works.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> Yes, even when I am old and gray-haired, God, don’t forsake me,<br/>
<span class="indented">until I have declared your strength to the next generation,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">your might to everyone who is to come.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> God, your righteousness also reaches to the heavens;<br/>
<span class="indented">you have done great things.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">God, who is like you?</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> You, who have shown us many and bitter troubles,<br/>
<span class="indented">you will let me live.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">You will bring us up again from the depths of the earth.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> Increase my honor,<br/>
<span class="indented">and comfort me again.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> I will also praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, my God.<br/>
<span class="indented">I sing praises to you with the lyre, Holy One of Israel.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> My lips shall shout for joy!<br/>
<span class="indented">My soul, which you have redeemed, sings praises to you!</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> My tongue will also talk about your righteousness all day long,<br/>
<span class="indented">for they are disappointed, and they are confounded,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">who want to harm me.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 14:19–35 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 14:19–35</h4>
<p>
<sup>19</sup> The evil bow down before the good,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> The poor person is shunned even by his own neighbor,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the rich person has many friends.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> He who despises his neighbor sins,<br/>
<span class="indented">but blessed is he who is kind to the humble.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> Don’t they go astray who plot evil?<br/>
<span class="indented">But love and faithfulness belong to those who plan good.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> In all hard work there is profit,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the talk of the lips leads only to poverty.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> The crown of the wise is their riches,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the folly of fools crowns them with folly.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> A truthful witness saves souls,<br/>
<span class="indented">but a false witness is deceitful.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> In the fear of the Lord is a secure fortress,<br/>
<span class="indented">and he will be a refuge for his children.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life,<br/>
<span class="indented">turning people from the snares of death.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> In the multitude of people is the king’s glory,<br/>
<span class="indented">but in the lack of people is the destruction of the prince.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> He who is slow to anger has great understanding,<br/>
<span class="indented">but he who has a quick temper displays folly.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> The life of the body is a heart at peace,<br/>
<span class="indented">but envy rots the bones.</span><br/>
<sup>31</sup> He who oppresses the poor shows contempt for his Maker,<br/>
<span class="indented">but he who is kind to the needy honors him.</span><br/>
<sup>32</sup> The wicked is brought down in his calamity,<br/>
<span class="indented">but in death, the righteous has a refuge.</span><br/>
<sup>33</sup> Wisdom rests in the heart of one who has understanding,<br/>
<span class="indented">and is even made known in the inward part of fools.</span><br/>
<sup>34</sup> Righteousness exalts a nation,<br/>
<span class="indented">but sin is a disgrace to any people.</span><br/>
<sup>35</sup> The king’s favor is toward a servant who deals wisely,<br/>
<span class="indented">but his wrath is towards one who causes shame.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 25 -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 25</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Three things I was beautified with, and stood up beautiful before the Lord and men:<br/>
<span class="indented">The unity of brethren, the friendship of neighbors, and a woman and her husband walking together in agreement.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> But three sorts of men my soul hates,<br/>
<span class="indented">and I am greatly offended at their life:</span><br/>
<span class="indented">a poor man that is arrogant, a rich man who is a liar,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and an old man who is an adulterer lacking understanding.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> In your youth you haven’t gathered,<br/>
<span class="indented">how then will you find anything in your old age?</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> How beautiful a thing is judgment for gray hairs,<br/>
<span class="indented">and for elders to know counsel!</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> How beautiful is the wisdom of old men,<br/>
<span class="indented">and thought and counsel to those who are honorable!</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Much experience is the crown of old men,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the fear of God is their glory.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> There are nine things that I have thought of,<br/>
<span class="indented">and my heart has magnified them:</span><br/>
<span class="indented">a man that delights in his children,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">a man who lives to see the fall of his enemies.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Blessed is he who dwells with a wife of understanding;<br/>
<span class="indented">he who has not slipped with his tongue,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and he who has not served a man who is unworthy of him.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Blessed is he who has found prudence.<br/>
<span class="indented">Even one who speaks in the ears of those who listen.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> How great is he who has found wisdom!<br/>
<span class="indented">Yet there is none above him who fears the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> The fear of the Lord passes all things.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who holds it, to whom shall he be likened?</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Any wound, but not a wound of the heart.<br/>
<span class="indented">Any wickedness, but not the wickedness of a wife.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Any attack, but not an attack from enemies.<br/>
<span class="indented">Any vengeance, but not the vengeance of enemies.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> There is no head worse than the head of a serpent.<br/>
<span class="indented">There is no anger above the anger of an enemy.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He who has indulged a wife in mischief</span><br/>
<span class="indented">will flee from her wrath.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> The wickedness of a woman changes her appearance,<br/>
<span class="indented">and darkens her countenance like a bear.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Her husband will sit among his neighbors,<br/>
<span class="indented">and when he hears it, he sighs bitterly.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> All malice is small compared to a woman’s malice.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let a sinner fall upon her!</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> As going up a sandy way for the feet of the aged,<br/>
<span class="indented">so is a wife full of words to a quiet man.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> Don’t be ensnared by a woman’s beauty,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t desire a woman for her possessions.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> There is anger, and impudence, and great reproach,<br/>
<span class="indented">if a woman supports her husband.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> A headstrong wife is a moth in her husband’s house,<br/>
<span class="indented">and she eats up his fortune piece by piece.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> A wicked woman abates the courage,<br/>
<span class="indented">makes a heavy countenance and a wounded heart.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">A woman that doesn’t make her husband happy</span><br/>
<span class="indented">weakens hands and slackens knees.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> From a woman came the beginning of sin,<br/>
<span class="indented">and because of her, we all die.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> Don’t give a woman power over you<br/>
<span class="indented">to trample upon your strength.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> Don’t go to meet a woman who plays the prostitute,<br/>
<span class="indented">lest perhaps you fall into her snares.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> Don’t be with a singer, lest you be caught by her attempts.<br/>
<sup>27</sup> Don’t gaze at a maid, lest you fall by those things<br/>
<span class="indented">that are precious in her.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> Don’t give your soul to prostitutes,<br/>
<span class="indented">that you not lose your inheritance.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> Don’t look around in the streets of the city,<br/>
<span class="indented">neither wander in its deserted places.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> Turn your eye away from a beautiful woman,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t gaze at another’s beauty.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Many have been led astray by the beauty of a woman;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">by it, passion is kindled like a fire.</span><br/>
<sup>31</sup> Don’t sit at all with another man’s wife,<br/>
<span class="indented">or share the wine with her in revelry,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">lest your heart turn away from her,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and you go down in blood to the pit.</span> </p></section>

<span class="indented">Its fruit sways like Lebanon.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Let it flourish like the grass of the field.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> His name endures forever.<br/>
<span class="indented">His name continues as long as the sun.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Men shall be blessed by him.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">All nations will call him blessed.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> Praise be to the Lord God, the God of Israel,<br/>
<span class="indented">who alone does marvelous deeds.</span><br/>

<h4>Psalm 73</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Surely God is good to Israel,<br/>

<sup>2</sup> But as for me, my feet were almost gone.<br/>
<span class="indented">My steps had nearly slipped.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> For I was envious of the arrogant,<br/>
<span class="indented">when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> For there are no struggles in their death,<br/>
<span class="indented">but their strength is firm.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> They are free from burdens of men,<br/>
<span class="indented">neither are they plagued like other men.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Therefore pride is like a chain around their neck.<br/>
<span class="indented">Violence covers them like a garment.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Their eyes bulge with fat.<br/>
<span class="indented">Their minds pass the limits of conceit.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> They scoff and speak with malice.<br/>
<span class="indented">In arrogance, they threaten oppression.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> They have set their mouth in the heavens.<br/>
<span class="indented">Their tongue walks through the earth.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Therefore their people return to them,<br/>
<span class="indented">and they drink up waters of abundance.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> They say, “How does God know?<br/>
<span class="indented">Is there knowledge in the Most High?”</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Behold, these are the wicked.<br/>
<span class="indented">Being always at ease, they increase in riches.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Surely I have cleansed my heart in vain,<br/>
<span class="indented">and washed my hands in innocence,</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> For all day long I have been plagued,<br/>
<span class="indented">and punished every morning.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> If I had said, “I will speak thus,”<br/>
<span class="indented">behold, I would have betrayed the generation of your children.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> When I tried to understand this,<br/>
<span class="indented">it was too painful for me—</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> until I entered God’s sanctuary,<br/>
<span class="indented">and considered their latter end.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> Surely you set them in slippery places.<br/>
<span class="indented">You throw them down to destruction.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> How they are suddenly destroyed!<br/>
<span class="indented">They are completely swept away by terrors.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> As a dream when one wakes up,<br/>
<span class="indented">so, Lord, when you awake, you will despise their fantasies.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> For my soul was grieved.<br/>
<span class="indented">I was embittered in my heart.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> I was so senseless and ignorant.<br/>
<span class="indented">I was a brute beast before you.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Nevertheless, I am continually with you.<br/>
<span class="indented">You have held my right hand.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> You will guide me with your counsel,<br/>
<span class="indented">and afterward receive me to glory.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> Whom do I have in heaven? There is no one on earth whom I desire besides you.<br/>
<sup>26</sup> My flesh and my heart fails,<br/>
<span class="indented">but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> For, behold, those who are far from you shall perish.<br/>
<span class="indented">You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> But it is good for me to come close to God.<br/>
<span class="indented">I have made the Lord God my refuge,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">that I may tell of all your works.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 15:1–15 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 15:1–15</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> A gentle answer turns away wrath,<br/>
<span class="indented">but a harsh word stirs up anger.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> The tongue of the wise commends knowledge,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the mouth of fools gush out folly.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> The Lord’s eyes are everywhere,<br/>
<span class="indented">keeping watch on the evil and the good.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> A gentle tongue is a tree of life,<br/>
<span class="indented">but deceit in it crushes the spirit.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> A fool despises his father’s correction,<br/>
<span class="indented">but he who heeds reproof shows prudence.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> In the house of the righteous is much treasure,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the income of the wicked brings trouble.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> The lips of the wise spread knowledge;<br/>
<span class="indented">not so with the heart of fools.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> The sacrifice made by the wicked is an abomination to the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the prayer of the upright is his delight.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> The way of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">but he loves him who follows after righteousness.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> There is stern discipline for one who forsakes the way.<br/>
<span class="indented">Whoever hates reproof shall die.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Sheol and Abaddon are before the Lord—<br/>
<span class="indented">how much more then the hearts of the children of men!</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> A scoffer doesn’t love to be reproved.<br/>
<span class="indented">He will not go to the wise.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> A glad heart makes a cheerful countenance,<br/>
<span class="indented">but an aching heart breaks the spirit.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> The heart of one who has understanding seeks knowledge,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the mouths of fools feed on folly.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> All the days of the afflicted are wretched,<br/>
<span class="indented">but one who has a cheerful heart enjoys a continual feast.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 26 -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 26</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Blessed is the man who has a virtuous wife,<br/>
<span class="indented">for the number of his days will be doubled.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> A noble wife rejoices her husband,<br/>
<span class="indented">and he will fulfill his years in peace.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> A good wife is a good portion;<br/>
<span class="indented">she will be given in the portion of those who fear the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Whether a man is rich or poor,<br/>
<span class="indented">he has a good heart toward the Lord;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">he will at all times cheerfully look on his face.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> There are three things which my heart fears,<br/>
<span class="indented">and concerning the fourth I am greatly afraid:</span><br/>
<span class="indented">the slander of a city,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">the gathering together of a mob,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and a false accusation.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">All these are worse than death.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> A grief of heart and sorrow is a woman who is jealous over another woman.<br/>
<span class="indented">Scourging of the tongue which communicates to all.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> A wicked wife is as a yoke of oxen shaken to and fro.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who takes hold of her is as one who grasps a scorpion.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> A drunken woman causes great wrath.<br/>
<span class="indented">She won’t cover her own shame.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> The whoredom of a woman is in the lifting up of her eyes;<br/>
<span class="indented">and it will be known by her eyelids.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Keep strict watch over a headstrong daughter,<br/>
<span class="indented">lest she find liberty for herself, and use it.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Watch over an impudent eye,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t be surprised if it trespasses against you.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> She will open her mouth, as a thirsty traveler does,<br/>
<span class="indented">and drink of every water that is near.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">She will sit down at every post,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and open her quiver against every arrow.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> The grace of a wife will delight her husband.<br/>
<span class="indented">Her knowledge will fatten his bones.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> A silent wife is a gift from the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">and there is nothing worth so much as a well-instructed soul.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> A modest wife is a blessing upon blessing.<br/>
<span class="indented">There is no scale adequate to weigh a self-controlled soul.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> As the sun when it arises in the Lord’s high heavens,<br/>
<span class="indented">so is the beauty of a good wife in her well-ordered house.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> As the lamp shining upon the holy candlestick,<br/>
<span class="indented">so is the beauty of the face in ripe age.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> As golden pillars upon a silver base,<br/>
<span class="indented">so are beautiful feet with the breasts of one who is steadfast.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> My son, keep the flower of your age sound;<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t give your strength to strangers.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> When you have gotten a fruitful possession in every field,<br/>
<span class="indented">sow it with your own seed, trusting in your noble descent.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> So your race which you leave will be magnified,<br/>
<span class="indented">having the confidence of their good descent.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> A harlot will be considered as spittle;<br/>
<span class="indented">but a married woman is a tower of death to those who use her.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> A wicked woman is given as a portion to a wicked man;<br/>
<span class="indented">but a godly woman is given to him who fears the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> A shameless woman deals shamefully with her father and husband;<br/>
<span class="indented">but a modest woman will fear the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> A woman that honors her husband will be judged wise by everyone;<br/>
<span class="indented">but she who dishonors him in her pride will be known to everyone as ungodly.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Blessed is the wife of a good husband,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for the number of her years will be doubled.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> A loud-voiced and garrulous woman is like a trumpet sounding the battle alarm,<br/>
<span class="indented">which signals the attack of an enemy.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> A wife who is envious of another woman’s virtue is a scourge to the heart.<br/>
<sup>28</sup> There are two things that grieve my heart,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the third arouses me to anger:</span><br/>
<span class="indented">a man of war who suffers poverty,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">men of understanding who are treated with contempt,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and one who turns from righteousness to sin—</span><br/>
<span class="indented">the Lord prepares such a one for the sword.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> A merchant can hardly keep himself from wrongdoing,<br/>
<span class="indented">and a shopkeeper will not be acquitted of sin.</span> </p></section>

<h2>Day 28</h2>
<!-- Psalms 74, 75 -->
<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 74</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> God, why have you rejected us forever?<br/>
<span class="indented">Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture?</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Remember your congregation, which you purchased of old,<br/>
<span class="indented">which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your inheritance:</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Mount Zion, in which you have lived.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Lift up your feet to the perpetual ruins,<br/>
<span class="indented">all the evil that the enemy has done in the sanctuary.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Your adversaries have roared in the middle of your assembly.<br/>
<span class="indented">They have set up their standards as signs.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> They behaved like men wielding axes,<br/>
<span class="indented">cutting through a thicket of trees.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Now they break all its carved work down with hatchet and hammers.<br/>
<sup>7</sup> They have burned your sanctuary to the ground.<br/>
<span class="indented">They have profaned the dwelling place of your Name.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> They said in their heart, “We will crush them completely.”<br/>
<span class="indented">They have burned up all the places in the land where God was worshiped.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> We see no miraculous signs.<br/>
<span class="indented">There is no longer any prophet,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">neither is there among us anyone who knows how long.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> How long, God, shall the adversary reproach?<br/>
<span class="indented">Shall the enemy blaspheme your name forever?</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Why do you draw back your hand, even your right hand?<br/>
<span class="indented">Take it from your chest and consume them!</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Yet God is my King of old,<br/>
<span class="indented">working salvation throughout the earth.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> You divided the sea by your strength.<br/>
<span class="indented">You broke the heads of the sea monsters in the waters.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> You broke the heads of Leviathan in pieces.<br/>
<span class="indented">You gave him as food to people and desert creatures.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> You opened up spring and stream.<br/>
<span class="indented">You dried up mighty rivers.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> The day is yours, the night is also yours.<br/>
<span class="indented">You have prepared the light and the sun.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> You have set all the boundaries of the earth.<br/>
<span class="indented">You have made summer and winter.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> Remember this, that the enemy has mocked you, Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">Foolish people have blasphemed your name.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> Don’t deliver the soul of your dove to wild beasts.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t forget the life of your poor forever.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> Honor your covenant,<br/>
<span class="indented">for haunts of violence fill the dark places of the earth.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> Don’t let the oppressed return ashamed.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let the poor and needy praise your name.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> Arise, God! Plead your own cause.<br/>
<span class="indented">Remember how the foolish man mocks you all day.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Don’t forget the voice of your adversaries.<br/>
<span class="indented">The tumult of those who rise up against you ascends continually.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 75</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> We give thanks to you, God.<br/>
<span class="indented">We give thanks, for your Name is near.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Men tell about your wondrous works.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> When I choose the appointed time,<br/>
<span class="indented">I will judge blamelessly.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> The earth and all its inhabitants quake.<br/>
<span class="indented">I firmly hold its pillars.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> I said to the arrogant, “Don’t boast!”<br/>
<span class="indented">I said to the wicked, “Don’t lift up the horn.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Don’t lift up your horn on high.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t speak with a stiff neck.”</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> For neither from the east, nor from the west,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor yet from the south, comes exaltation.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> But God is the judge.<br/>
<span class="indented">He puts down one, and lifts up another.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> For in the Lord’s hand there is a cup,<br/>
<span class="indented">full of foaming wine mixed with spices.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He pours it out.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Indeed the wicked of the earth drink and drain it to its dregs.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> But I will declare this forever:<br/>
<span class="indented">I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> I will cut off all the horns of the wicked,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 15:16–33 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 15:16–33</h4>
<p>
<sup>16</sup> Better is a little with the fear of the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">than great treasure with trouble.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Better is a dinner of herbs, where love is,<br/>
<span class="indented">than a fattened calf with hatred.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> A wrathful man stirs up contention,<br/>
<span class="indented">but one who is slow to anger appeases strife.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> The way of the sluggard is blocked with thorns,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the path of the upright is a highway.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> A wise son makes a father glad,<br/>
<span class="indented">but a foolish man despises his mother.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> Folly is joy to one who is void of wisdom,<br/>
<span class="indented">but a man of understanding keeps his way straight.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> Where there is no counsel, plans fail;<br/>
<span class="indented">but in a multitude of counselors they are established.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Joy comes to a man with the reply of his mouth.<br/>
<span class="indented">How good is a word at the right time!</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> The path of life leads upward for the wise,<br/>
<span class="indented">to keep him from going downward to Sheol.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> The Lord will uproot the house of the proud,<br/>
<span class="indented">but he will keep the widow’s borders intact.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> The Lord detests the thoughts of the wicked,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the thoughts of the pure are pleasing.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> He who is greedy for gain troubles his own house,<br/>
<span class="indented">but he who hates bribes will live.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> The heart of the righteous weighs answers,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the mouth of the wicked gushes out evil.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> The Lord is far from the wicked,<br/>
<span class="indented">but he hears the prayer of the righteous.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> The light of the eyes rejoices the heart.<br/>
<span class="indented">Good news puts fat on the bones.</span><br/>
<sup>31</sup> The ear that listens to reproof lives,<br/>
<span class="indented">and will remain among the wise.</span><br/>
<sup>32</sup> He who refuses correction despises his own soul,<br/>
<span class="indented">but he who listens to reproof gets understanding.</span><br/>
<sup>33</sup> The fear of the Lord teaches wisdom.<br/>
<span class="indented">Before honor is humility.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 27 -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 27</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Many have sinned for a small matter;<br/>
<span class="indented">he who seeks for abundance will turn his eyes away.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> As a stake is driven firmly into a fissure between stones,<br/>
<span class="indented">so sin thrusts in between buying and selling.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Unless a man holds diligently to the fear of the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">his house will soon be overthrown.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> In the shaking of a sieve, the refuse remains,<br/>
<span class="indented">so the filth of man in his reasoning.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> The furnace tests the potter’s vessel;<br/>
<span class="indented">so the test of man is in his reasoning.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> The fruit of a tree discloses the cultivation of it.<br/>
<span class="indented">So the declaration of a man’s reasoning is the test of him.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Praise no man before you hear his reasoning;<br/>
<span class="indented">for this is the test of men.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> If you follow righteousness, you will obtain her,<br/>
<span class="indented">and put her on as a splendid robe.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Birds will resort to their like;<br/>
<span class="indented">and truth will return to those who practice her.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> The lion lies in wait for prey;<br/>
<span class="indented">so does sin for those who work iniquity.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> The discourse of a godly man is always wisdom,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the foolish man changes like the moon.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Among stupid people, watch for a chance to depart;<br/>
<span class="indented">but among thoughtful people, linger on.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> The discourse of fools is offensive,<br/>
<span class="indented">and their laughter is in the wantonness of sin.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> The talk of men given to swearing makes one’s hair stand upright,<br/>
<span class="indented">and their quarrels make people stop their ears.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> The strife of the proud ends in bloodshed,<br/>
<span class="indented">and their insults are grievous to hear.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> He who reveals secrets destroys credit,<br/>
<span class="indented">and will not find a close friend.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Love your friend, and be faithful to him;<br/>
<span class="indented">but if you reveal his secrets, don’t follow him any more.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> For as a man has destroyed his enemy,<br/>
<span class="indented">so have you destroyed the friendship of your neighbor.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> As you have let a bird out of your hand,<br/>
<span class="indented">so have you let your neighbor go, and will not catch him again.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> Don’t go after him, for he is gone far away,<br/>
<span class="indented">and has escaped like a gazelle out of the snare.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> For a wound may be bound up,<br/>
<span class="indented">and an insult is forgiven;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">but he who betrays secrets is without hope.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> One who winks with the eye contrives evil;<br/>
<span class="indented">and no one will remove him from it.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> When you are present, he speaks sweetly,<br/>
<span class="indented">and will admire your words;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">but afterward he will twist his speech,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and set a trap in your words.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> I have hated many things, but I have not done as he did,<br/>
<span class="indented">neither will I do it, at any price.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> One throws a stone on high; it will fall on his own head;<br/>
<span class="indented">and a deceitful stroke will open wounds.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> He who digs a pit will fall into it;<br/>
<span class="indented">he who sets a snare will be caught in it.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> If a man does evil, it will roll back upon him,<br/>
<span class="indented">and he won’t know where it came from.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> Mockery and reproach are from the proud;<br/>
<span class="indented">and vengeance, as a lion, will lie in wait for him.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> Those who rejoice at the fall of the godly will be taken in a snare,<br/>
<span class="indented">and anguish will consume them before they die.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> Wrath and anger, these also are abominations;<br/>
<span class="indented">and a sinful man will possess them.</span> </p></section>

<p>
<sup>1</sup> In Judah, God is known.<br/>
<span class="indented">His name is great in Israel.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> His tabernacle is also in Salem.<br/>
<span class="indented">His dwelling place in Zion.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> There he broke the flaming arrows of the bow,<br/>
<span class="indented">the shield, and the sword, and the weapons of war.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Glorious are you, and excellent,<br/>
<span class="indented">more than mountains of game.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Valiant men lie plundered.<br/>
<span class="indented">They have slept their last sleep.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">None of the men of war can lift their hands.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> At your rebuke, God of Jacob,<br/>
<span class="indented">both chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> You, even you, are to be feared.<br/>
<span class="indented">Who can stand in your sight when you are angry?</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> You pronounced judgment from heaven.<br/>
<span class="indented">The earth feared, and was silent,</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> when God arose to judgment,<br/>
<span class="indented">to save all the afflicted ones of the earth.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Surely the wrath of man praises you.<br/>
<span class="indented">The survivors of your wrath are restrained.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Make vows to the Lord your God, and fulfill them!<br/>
<span class="indented">Let all of his neighbors bring presents to him who is to be feared.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> He will cut off the spirit of princes.<br/>
<span class="indented">He is feared by the kings of the earth.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 77</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> My cry goes to God! Indeed, I cry to God for help,<br/>
<span class="indented">and for him to listen to me.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">My hand was stretched out in the night, and didn’t get tired.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">My soul refused to be comforted.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> I remember God, and I groan.<br/>
<span class="indented">I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> You hold my eyelids open.<br/>
<span class="indented">I am so troubled that I can’t speak.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> I have considered the days of old,<br/>
<span class="indented">the years of ancient times.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> I remember my song in the night.<br/>
<span class="indented">I consider in my own heart.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">My spirit diligently inquires:</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> “Will the Lord reject us forever?<br/>
<span class="indented">Will he be favorable no more?</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Has his loving kindness vanished forever?<br/>
<span class="indented">Does his promise fail for generations?</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Has God forgotten to be gracious?<br/>
<span class="indented">Has he, in anger, withheld his compassion?”</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Then I thought, “I will appeal to this:<br/>
<span class="indented">the years of the right hand of the Most High.”</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> I will remember the Lord’s deeds;<br/>
<span class="indented">for I will remember your wonders of old.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> I will also meditate on all your work,<br/>
<span class="indented">and consider your doings.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Your way, God, is in the sanctuary.<br/>
<span class="indented">What god is great like God?</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> You are the God who does wonders.<br/>
<span class="indented">You have made your strength known among the peoples.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> You have redeemed your people with your arm,<br/>
<span class="indented">the sons of Jacob and Joseph.</span><br/>

<sup>16</sup> The waters saw you, God.<br/>
<span class="indented">The waters saw you, and they writhed.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">The depths also convulsed.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> The clouds poured out water.<br/>
<span class="indented">The skies resounded with thunder.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Your arrows also flashed around.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind.<br/>
<span class="indented">The lightnings lit up the world.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">The earth trembled and shook.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> Your way was through the sea,<br/>
<span class="indented">your paths through the great waters.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Your footsteps were not known.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> You led your people like a flock,<br/>
<span class="indented">by the hand of Moses and Aaron.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 16:1–17 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 16:1–17</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> The plans of the heart belong to man,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the answer of the tongue is from the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes;<br/>
<span class="indented">but the Lord weighs the motives.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Commit your deeds to the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">and your plans shall succeed.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> The Lord has made everything for its own end—<br/>
<span class="indented">yes, even the wicked for the day of evil.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Everyone who is proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord;<br/>
<span class="indented">they shall certainly not be unpunished.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> By mercy and truth iniquity is atoned for.<br/>
<span class="indented">By the fear of the Lord men depart from evil.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> When a man’s ways please the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Better is a little with righteousness,<br/>
<span class="indented">than great revenues with injustice.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> A man’s heart plans his course,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the Lord directs his steps.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Inspired judgments are on the lips of the king.<br/>
<span class="indented">He shall not betray his mouth.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Honest balances and scales are the Lord’s.<br/>
<span class="indented">All the weights in the bag are his work.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> It is an abomination for kings to do wrong,<br/>
<span class="indented">for the throne is established by righteousness.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Righteous lips are the delight of kings.<br/>
<span class="indented">They value one who speaks the truth.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> The king’s wrath is a messenger of death,<br/>
<span class="indented">but a wise man will pacify it.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> In the light of the king’s face is life.<br/>
<span class="indented">His favor is like a cloud of the spring rain.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> How much better it is to get wisdom than gold!<br/>
<span class="indented">Yes, to get understanding is to be chosen rather than silver.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> The highway of the upright is to depart from evil.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who keeps his way preserves his soul.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 28 -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 28</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> He who takes vengeance will find vengeance from the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">and he will surely keep his sins in remembrance.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Forgive your neighbor the wrong he has done,<br/>
<span class="indented">and then your sins will be pardoned when you pray.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Does one man harbor anger against another,<br/>
<span class="indented">and yet seek healing from the Lord?</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Does he have no mercy on a man like himself,<br/>
<span class="indented">and yet pray for his own sins?</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> If he who is flesh nourishes wrath,<br/>
<span class="indented">who will make atonement for his sins?</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Remember your end, and let enmity cease.<br/>
<span class="indented">Remember corruption and death,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and be true to the commandments.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Remember the commandments,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t be angry with your neighbor.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Remember the covenant of the Highest,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and overlook ignorance.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Abstain from strife, and you will diminish your sins;<br/>
<span class="indented">for a furious man kindles strife.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> A sinful man disquiets friends,<br/>
<span class="indented">and sows discord among those who are at peace.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> As the matter of the fire is, so it burns;<br/>
<span class="indented">and as a man’s strength is, so does his anger be;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and as his wealth is, so he exalts his wrath.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> A hasty contention kindles a fire;<br/>
<span class="indented">and a hasty fighting sheds blood.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> If you blow on a spark, it will burn.<br/>
<span class="indented">If you spit on it, it will be put out;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">yet both come out of your mouth.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Curse the whisperer and the double-tongued,<br/>
<span class="indented">for he has destroyed many who were at peace.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Slander has shaken mighty cities<br/>
<span class="indented">and overthrown the houses of great men.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Slander has driven away brave women<br/>
<span class="indented">and deprived them of their labors.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Whoever listens to it will not find rest;<br/>
<span class="indented">nor will he dwell in quietness.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> The stroke of a whip makes marks in the flesh,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the stroke of the tongue breaks bones.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> Many have fallen by the edge of the sword,<br/>
<span class="indented">yet not as many as those who have perished by their own tongue.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> Happy is he who is sheltered from it,<br/>
<span class="indented">who has not passed through the anger of its tongue,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">who has not drawn its yoke,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and has not been bound by its bands.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> For its yoke is a yoke of iron;<br/>
<span class="indented">and its bands are bands of brass.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> The death it inflicts is an evil death.<br/>
<span class="indented">The grave is better than it.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> It will not have rule over godly men;<br/>
<span class="indented">and they will not be burned in its flame.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Those who forsake the Lord will fall into it.<br/>
<span class="indented">It will burn among them and not be put out.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">It will be sent out against them like a lion,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and as a leopard, it will destroy them.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> Look that you hedge your possession about with thorns.<br/>
<span class="indented">Bind up your silver and gold.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> Make balances and scales for your words,<br/>
<span class="indented">and make a door and a bar for your mouth.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> Beware that you don’t err with your tongue,<br/>
<span class="indented">and fall victim in front of those who lie in wait for you.</span> </p></section>

<!-- Psalms 78 -->
<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 78</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Hear my teaching, my people.<br/>
<span class="indented">Turn your ears to the words of my mouth.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> I will open my mouth in a parable.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will utter dark sayings of old,</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> which we have heard and known,<br/>
<span class="indented">and our fathers have told us.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> We will not hide them from their children,<br/>
<span class="indented">telling to the generation to come the praises of the Lord,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">his strength, and his wondrous deeds that he has done.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> For he established a covenant in Jacob,<br/>
<span class="indented">and appointed a law in Israel,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">which he commanded our fathers,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">that they should make them known to their children,</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> that the generation to come might know—the children who would be born,<br/>
<span class="indented">who should arise and tell their children,</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> that they might set their hope in God,<br/>
<span class="indented">and not forget God’s deeds,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">but keep his commandments,</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> and might not be as their fathers—a stubborn and rebellious generation,<br/>
<span class="indented">a generation that didn’t make their hearts loyal,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">whose spirit was not steadfast with God.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows,<br/>
<span class="indented">turned back in the day of battle.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> They didn’t keep God’s covenant,<br/>
<span class="indented">and refused to walk in his law.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> They forgot his doings,<br/>
<span class="indented">his wondrous deeds that he had shown them.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers,<br/>
<span class="indented">in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> He split the sea, and caused them to pass through.<br/>
<span class="indented">He made the waters stand as a heap.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> In the daytime he also led them with a cloud,<br/>
<span class="indented">and all night with a light of fire.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> He split rocks in the wilderness,<br/>
<span class="indented">and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> He brought streams also out of the rock,<br/>
<span class="indented">and caused waters to run down like rivers.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Yet they still went on to sin against him,<br/>
<span class="indented">to rebel against the Most High in the desert.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> They tempted God in their heart<br/>
<span class="indented">by asking food according to their desire.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> Yes, they spoke against God.<br/>
<span class="indented">They said, “Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out,<br/>
<span class="indented">and streams overflowed.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Can he give bread also?</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Will he provide meat for his people?”</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> Therefore the Lord heard, and was angry.<br/>
<span class="indented">A fire was kindled against Jacob,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">anger also went up against Israel,</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> because they didn’t believe in God,<br/>
<span class="indented">and didn’t trust in his salvation.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Yet he commanded the skies above,<br/>
<span class="indented">and opened the doors of heaven.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> He rained down manna on them to eat,<br/>
<span class="indented">and gave them food from the sky.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> Man ate the bread of angels.<br/>
<span class="indented">He sent them food to the full.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> He caused the east wind to blow in the sky.<br/>
<span class="indented">By his power he guided the south wind.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> He also rained meat on them as the dust,<br/>
<span class="indented">winged birds as the sand of the seas.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> He let them fall in the middle of their camp,<br/>
<span class="indented">around their habitations.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> So they ate, and were filled.<br/>
<span class="indented">He gave them their own desire.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> They didn’t turn from their cravings.<br/>
<span class="indented">Their food was yet in their mouths,</span><br/>
<sup>31</sup> when the anger of God went up against them,<br/>
<span class="indented">killed some of their strongest,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and struck down the young men of Israel.</span><br/>
<sup>32</sup> For all this they still sinned,<br/>
<span class="indented">and didn’t believe in his wondrous works.</span><br/>
<sup>33</sup> Therefore he consumed their days in vanity,<br/>
<span class="indented">and their years in terror.</span><br/>
<sup>34</sup> When he killed them, then they inquired after him.<br/>
<span class="indented">They returned and sought God earnestly.</span><br/>
<sup>35</sup> They remembered that God was their rock,<br/>
<span class="indented">the Most High God, their redeemer.</span><br/>
<sup>36</sup> But they flattered him with their mouth,<br/>
<span class="indented">and lied to him with their tongue.</span><br/>
<sup>37</sup> For their heart was not right with him,<br/>
<span class="indented">neither were they faithful in his covenant.</span><br/>
<sup>38</sup> But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity,<br/>
<span class="indented">and didn’t destroy them.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Yes, many times he turned his anger away,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and didn’t stir up all his wrath.</span><br/>
<sup>39</sup> He remembered that they were but flesh,<br/>
<span class="indented">a wind that passes away, and doesn’t come again.</span><br/>
<sup>40</sup> How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness,<br/>
<span class="indented">and grieved him in the desert!</span><br/>
<sup>41</sup> They turned again and tempted God,<br/>
<span class="indented">and provoked the Holy One of Israel.</span><br/>
<sup>42</sup> They didn’t remember his hand,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;</span><br/>
<sup>43</sup> how he set his signs in Egypt,<br/>
<span class="indented">his wonders in the field of Zoan,</span><br/>
<sup>44</sup> turned their rivers into blood,<br/>
<span class="indented">and their streams, so that they could not drink.</span><br/>
<sup>45</sup> He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them;<br/>
<span class="indented">and frogs, which destroyed them.</span><br/>
<sup>46</sup> He also gave their increase to the caterpillar,<br/>
<span class="indented">and their labor to the locust.</span><br/>
<sup>47</sup> He destroyed their vines with hail,<br/>
<span class="indented">their sycamore fig trees with frost.</span><br/>
<sup>48</sup> He also gave over their livestock to the hail,<br/>
<span class="indented">and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</span><br/>
<sup>49</sup> He threw on them the fierceness of his anger,<br/>
<span class="indented">wrath, indignation, and trouble,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and a band of angels of evil.</span><br/>
<sup>50</sup> He made a path for his anger.<br/>
<span class="indented">He didn’t spare their soul from death,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">but gave their life over to the pestilence,</span><br/>
<sup>51</sup> and struck all the firstborn in Egypt,<br/>
<span class="indented">the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.</span><br/>
<sup>52</sup> But he led out his own people like sheep,<br/>
<span class="indented">and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</span><br/>
<sup>53</sup> He led them safely, so that they weren’t afraid,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</span><br/>
<sup>54</sup> He brought them to the border of his sanctuary,<br/>
<span class="indented">to this mountain, which his right hand had taken.</span><br/>
<sup>55</sup> He also drove out the nations before them,<br/>
<span class="indented">allotted them for an inheritance by line,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</span><br/>
<sup>56</sup> Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God,<br/>
<span class="indented">and didn’t keep his testimonies,</span><br/>
<sup>57</sup> but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers.<br/>
<span class="indented">They were twisted like a deceitful bow.</span><br/>
<sup>58</sup> For they provoked him to anger with their high places,<br/>
<span class="indented">and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.</span><br/>
<sup>59</sup> When God heard this, he was angry,<br/>
<span class="indented">and greatly abhorred Israel;</span><br/>
<sup>60</sup> so that he forsook the tent of Shiloh,<br/>
<span class="indented">the tent which he placed among men,</span><br/>
<sup>61</sup> and delivered his strength into captivity,<br/>
<span class="indented">his glory into the adversary’s hand.</span><br/>
<sup>62</sup> He also gave his people over to the sword,<br/>
<span class="indented">and was angry with his inheritance.</span><br/>
<sup>63</sup> Fire devoured their young men.<br/>
<span class="indented">Their virgins had no wedding song.</span><br/>
<sup>64</sup> Their priests fell by the sword,<br/>
<span class="indented">and their widows couldn’t weep.</span><br/>
<sup>65</sup> Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep,<br/>
<span class="indented">like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.</span><br/>
<sup>66</sup> He struck his adversaries backward.<br/>
<span class="indented">He put them to a perpetual reproach.</span><br/>
<sup>67</sup> Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph,<br/>
<span class="indented">and didn’t choose the tribe of Ephraim,</span><br/>
<sup>68</sup> but chose the tribe of Judah,<br/>
<span class="indented">Mount Zion which he loved.</span><br/>
<sup>69</sup> He built his sanctuary like the heights,<br/>
<span class="indented">like the earth which he has established forever.</span><br/>
<sup>70</sup> He also chose David his servant,<br/>
<span class="indented">and took him from the sheepfolds;</span><br/>
<sup>71</sup> from following the ewes that have their young,<br/>
<span class="indented">he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and Israel, his inheritance.</span><br/>
<sup>72</sup> So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart,<br/>
<span class="indented">and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 16:18–33 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 16:18–33</h4>
<p>
<sup>18</sup> Pride goes before destruction,<br/>
<span class="indented">and a haughty spirit before a fall.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> It is better to be of a lowly spirit with the poor,<br/>
<span class="indented">than to divide the plunder with the proud.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> He who heeds the Word finds prosperity.<br/>
<span class="indented">Whoever trusts in the Lord is blessed.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> The wise in heart shall be called prudent.<br/>
<span class="indented">Pleasantness of the lips promotes instruction.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> Understanding is a fountain of life to one who has it,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the punishment of fools is their folly.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> The heart of the wise instructs his mouth,<br/>
<span class="indented">and adds learning to his lips.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> Pleasant words are a honeycomb,<br/>
<span class="indented">sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> There is a way which seems right to a man,<br/>
<span class="indented">but in the end it leads to death.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> The appetite of the laboring man labors for him;<br/>
<span class="indented">for his mouth urges him on.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> A worthless man devises mischief.<br/>
<span class="indented">His speech is like a scorching fire.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> A perverse man stirs up strife.<br/>
<span class="indented">A whisperer separates close friends.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> A man of violence entices his neighbor,<br/>
<span class="indented">and leads him in a way that is not good.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> One who winks his eyes to plot perversities,<br/>
<span class="indented">one who compresses his lips, is bent on evil.</span><br/>
<sup>31</sup> Gray hair is a crown of glory.<br/>
<span class="indented">It is attained by a life of righteousness.</span><br/>
<sup>32</sup> One who is slow to anger is better than the mighty;<br/>
<span class="indented">one who rules his spirit, than he who takes a city.</span><br/>
<sup>33</sup> The lot is cast into the lap,<br/>
<span class="indented">but its every decision is from the Lord.</span> </p> <!-- (No Sirach reading for Day 30) -->

<!-- Psalms 79, 80 -->
<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 79</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> God, the nations have come into your inheritance.<br/>
<span class="indented">They have defiled your holy temple.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> They have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food for the birds of the sky,<br/>
<span class="indented">the flesh of your saints to the animals of the earth.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> They have shed their blood like water around Jerusalem.<br/>
<span class="indented">There was no one to bury them.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> We have become a reproach to our neighbors,<br/>
<span class="indented">a scoffing and derision to those who are around us.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> How long, Lord? Will you be angry forever?<br/>
<span class="indented">Will your jealousy burn like fire?</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Pour out your wrath on the nations that don’t know you,<br/>
<span class="indented">on the kingdoms that don’t call on your name,</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> for they have devoured Jacob,<br/>
<span class="indented">and destroyed his homeland.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Don’t hold the iniquities of our forefathers against us.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let your tender mercies speedily meet us,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for we are in desperate need.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Help us, God of our salvation, for the glory of your name.<br/>
<span class="indented">Deliver us, and forgive our sins, for your name’s sake.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?”<br/>
<span class="indented">Let it be known among the nations, before our eyes,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">that vengeance for your servants’ blood is being poured out.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Let the sighing of the prisoner come before you.<br/>
<span class="indented">According to the greatness of your power, preserve those who are sentenced to death.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Pay back to our neighbors seven times into their bosom their reproach with which they have reproached you, Lord.<br/>
<sup>13</sup> So we, your people and sheep of your pasture,<br/>
<span class="indented">will give you thanks forever.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">We will praise you forever, to all generations.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 80</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Hear us, Shepherd of Israel,<br/>
<span class="indented">you who lead Joseph like a flock,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">you who sit above the cherubim, shine out.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up your might.<br/>
<span class="indented">Come to save us!</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Turn us again, God.<br/>
<span class="indented">Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Lord God of Armies,<br/>
<span class="indented">how long will you be angry against the prayer of your people?</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> You have fed them with the bread of tears,<br/>
<span class="indented">and given them tears to drink in large measure.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> You make us a source of contention to our neighbors.<br/>
<span class="indented">Our enemies laugh among themselves.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Turn us again, God of Armies.<br/>
<span class="indented">Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> You brought a vine out of Egypt.<br/>
<span class="indented">You drove out the nations, and planted it.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> You cleared the ground for it.<br/>
<span class="indented">It took deep root, and filled the land.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> The mountains were covered with its shadow.<br/>
<span class="indented">Its boughs were like God’s cedars.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> It sent out its branches to the sea,<br/>
<span class="indented">its shoots to the River.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Why have you broken down its walls,<br/>
<span class="indented">so that all those who pass by the way pluck it?</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> The boar out of the wood ravages it.<br/>
<span class="indented">The wild animals of the field feed on it.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Turn again, we beg you, God of Armies.<br/>
<span class="indented">Look down from heaven, and see, and visit this vine,</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> the stock which your right hand planted,<br/>
<span class="indented">the branch that you made strong for yourself.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> It’s burned with fire.<br/>
<span class="indented">It’s cut down.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">They perish at your rebuke.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Let your hand be on the man of your right hand,<br/>
<span class="indented">on the son of man whom you made strong for yourself.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> So we will not turn away from you.<br/>
<span class="indented">Revive us, and we will call on your name.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> Turn us again, Lord God of Armies.<br/>
<span class="indented">Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 17:1–14 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 17:1–14</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Better is a dry morsel with quietness,<br/>
<span class="indented">than a house full of feasting with strife.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> A servant who deals wisely will rule over a son who causes shame,<br/>
<span class="indented">and shall have a part in the inheritance among the brothers.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the Lord tests the hearts.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> An evildoer heeds wicked lips.<br/>
<span class="indented">A liar gives ear to a mischievous tongue.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Whoever mocks the poor reproaches his Maker.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who is glad at calamity shall not be unpunished.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Children’s children are the crown of old men;<br/>
<span class="indented">the glory of children are their parents.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Arrogant speech isn’t fitting for a fool,<br/>
<span class="indented">much less do lying lips fit a prince.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> A bribe is a precious stone in the eyes of him who gives it;<br/>
<span class="indented">wherever he turns, he prospers.</span><br/>

<span class="indented">but he who repeats a matter separates best friends.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> A rebuke enters deeper into one who has understanding<br/>
<span class="indented">than a hundred lashes into a fool.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> An evil man seeks only rebellion;<br/>
<span class="indented">therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Let a bear robbed of her cubs meet a man,<br/>
<span class="indented">rather than a fool in his folly.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Whoever rewards evil for good,<br/>
<span class="indented">evil shall not depart from his house.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> The beginning of strife is like breaching a dam,<br/>
<span class="indented">therefore stop contention before quarreling breaks out.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 29 -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 29</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> He who shows mercy will lend to his neighbor.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who strengthens him with his hand keeps the commandments.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Lend to your neighbor in time of his need.<br/>
<span class="indented">Pay your neighbor again in due season.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Confirm your word, and keep faith with him;<br/>
<span class="indented">and at all seasons, you will find what you need.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Many have considered a loan as a windfall,<br/>
<span class="indented">and have caused trouble to those who helped them.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> When he has gotten possession, he will kiss your hands,<br/>
<span class="indented">and when he is due to repay, he will delay the time,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">return words of heaviness, and complain of the time.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> If he prevails, he will barely get half,<br/>
<span class="indented">and he will consider that as if he had found it.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">If not, he has deprived him of his money,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and he has gotten him for an enemy without cause.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He will pay him with curses and insults,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and instead of honor, he will pay him disgrace.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Many have refused to lend for fear of being defrauded,<br/>
<span class="indented">yet they have been defrauded anyway by bold persons.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Nevertheless, be patient with a man in poor circumstances;<br/>
<span class="indented">don’t keep him waiting for your alms.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Help a poor man for the commandment’s sake.<br/>
<span class="indented">According to his need, don’t send him away empty.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Lose your money for a brother or a friend.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t let it rust under a stone and be lost.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Lay up your treasure according to the commandments of the Most High,<br/>
<span class="indented">and it will profit you more than gold.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Store up alms in your storehouses;<br/>
<span class="indented">it will deliver you from all affliction.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> It will fight for you against your enemy<br/>
<span class="indented">better than a mighty shield and a strong spear.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> A good man will be surety for his neighbor;<br/>
<span class="indented">but one who has lost his shame will fail him.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Don’t forget the good offices of your surety,<br/>
<span class="indented">for he has given his life for you.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> A sinner wastes the good offices of his surety.<br/>
<sup>17</sup> The unthankful man forgets him who delivered him.<br/>
<sup>18</sup> Suretyship has undone many who were doing well,<br/>
<span class="indented">and shaken them as a wave of the sea.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Mighty men it has driven from their homes;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">they wandered among foreign nations.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> A sinner who falls into suretyship,<br/>
<span class="indented">and undertakes contracts for work, will fall into lawsuits.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> Help your neighbor according to your power,<br/>
<span class="indented">and take heed to yourself that you don’t fall into the same.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> The essentials of life are water, bread, and a garment,<br/>
<span class="indented">and a house to cover nakedness.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> Better is the life of a poor man under a shelter of logs<br/>
<span class="indented">than sumptuous fare in another man’s house.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Be content with little or much.<br/>
<span class="indented">It is a miserable life to go from house to house.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> Where you are a guest, you dare not open your mouth.<br/>
<span class="indented">You will entertain and give to drink, and have no thanks;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">besides this, you will hear bitter words:</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> “Come here, stranger, set the table.<br/>
<span class="indented">Feed me the things that you have ready.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> Go away, stranger, give place to someone of honor.<br/>
<span class="indented">My brother has come to be my guest. I need my house.”</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> These things are grievous to a man of understanding:<br/>
<span class="indented">upbraiding about lodging and the reproach of the creditor.</span> </p></section>

<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 81</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Sing aloud to God, our strength!<br/>
<span class="indented">Make a joyful shout to the God of Jacob!</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Raise a song, and bring here the tambourine,<br/>
<span class="indented">the pleasant lyre with the harp.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Blow the trumpet at the New Moon,<br/>
<span class="indented">at the full moon, on our feast day.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> For it is a statute for Israel,<br/>
<span class="indented">an ordinance of the God of Jacob.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> He appointed it in Joseph as a testimony,<br/>
<span class="indented">when he went out over the land of Egypt.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I heard a language that I didn’t know.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> “I removed his shoulder from the burden.<br/>
<span class="indented">His hands were freed from the basket.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> You called in trouble, and I delivered you.<br/>
<span class="indented">I answered you in the secret place of thunder.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I tested you at the waters of Meribah.”</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> “Hear, my people, and I will testify to you,<br/>
<span class="indented">Israel, if you would listen to me!</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> There shall be no strange god in you,<br/>
<span class="indented">neither shall you worship any foreign god.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> I am the Lord, your God,<br/>
<span class="indented">who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> But my people didn’t listen to my voice.<br/>
<span class="indented">Israel desired none of me.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> So I let them go after the stubbornness of their hearts,<br/>
<span class="indented">that they might walk in their own counsels.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Oh that my people would listen to me,<br/>
<span class="indented">that Israel would walk in my ways!</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> I would soon subdue their enemies,<br/>
<span class="indented">and turn my hand against their adversaries.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> The haters of the Lord would cringe before him,<br/>
<span class="indented">and their punishment would last forever.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> But he would have also fed them with the finest of the wheat.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will satisfy you with honey out of the rock.”</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 82</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> God presides in the great assembly.<br/>
<span class="indented">He judges among the gods.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> “How long will you judge unjustly,<br/>
<span class="indented">and show partiality to the wicked?”</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> “Defend the weak, the poor, and the fatherless.<br/>
<span class="indented">Maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Rescue the weak and needy.<br/>
<span class="indented">Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked.”</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> They don’t know, neither do they understand.<br/>
<span class="indented">They walk back and forth in darkness.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">All the foundations of the earth are shaken.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> I said, “You are gods.<br/>
<span class="indented">All of you are sons of the Most High.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Nevertheless you shall die like men,<br/>
<span class="indented">and fall like one of the rulers.”</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Arise, God, judge the earth,<br/>
<span class="indented">for you inherit all of the nations.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 83</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> God, don’t keep silent.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t keep silent,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t be still, God.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> For behold, your enemies are stirred up.<br/>
<span class="indented">Those who hate you have lifted up their heads.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> They conspire with cunning against your people.<br/>
<span class="indented">They plot against your cherished ones.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> “Come,” they say, “let’s destroy them as a nation,<br/>
<span class="indented">that the name of Israel may be remembered no more.”</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> For they have conspired together with one mind.<br/>
<span class="indented">They form an alliance against you.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites;<br/>
<span class="indented">Moab, and the Hagrites;</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek;<br/>
<span class="indented">Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Assyria also is joined with them.<br/>
<span class="indented">They have helped the children of Lot.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Do to them as you did to Midian,<br/>
<span class="indented">as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon;</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> who perished at Endor,<br/>
<span class="indented">who became as dung for the earth.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb;<br/>
<span class="indented">yes, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna;</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> who said, “Let’s take possession of God’s pasturelands.”<br/>
<sup>13</sup> My God, make them like tumbleweed,<br/>
<span class="indented">like chaff before the wind.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> As the fire that burns the forest,<br/>
<span class="indented">as the flame that sets the mountains on fire,</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> so pursue them with your tempest,<br/>
<span class="indented">and terrify them with your storm.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Fill their faces with confusion,<br/>
<span class="indented">that they may seek your name, Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Let them be disappointed and dismayed forever.<br/>
<span class="indented">Yes, let them be confounded and perish,</span><br/>

<span class="indented">are the Most High over all the earth.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 17:15–28 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 17:15–28</h4>
<p>
<sup>15</sup> He who justifies the wicked, and he who condemns the righteous—<br/>
<span class="indented">both of them alike are an abomination to the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Why is there money in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom,<br/>
<span class="indented">since he has no understanding?</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> A friend loves at all times;<br/>
<span class="indented">and a brother is born for adversity.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> A man void of understanding strikes hands,<br/>
<span class="indented">and becomes collateral in the presence of his neighbor.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> He who loves disobedience loves strife.<br/>
<span class="indented">One who builds a high gate seeks destruction.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> One who has a perverse heart doesn’t find prosperity,<br/>
<span class="indented">and one who has a deceitful tongue falls into trouble.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> He who becomes the father of a fool grieves.<br/>
<span class="indented">The father of a fool has no joy.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> A cheerful heart makes good medicine,<br/>
<span class="indented">but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> A wicked man receives a bribe in secret,<br/>
<span class="indented">to pervert the ways of justice.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> Wisdom is before the face of one who has understanding,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the eyes of a fool wander to the ends of the earth.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> A foolish son brings grief to his father,<br/>
<span class="indented">and bitterness to her who bore him.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> Also to punish the righteous is not good,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor to flog officials for their integrity.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> He who spares his words has knowledge.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who is even tempered is a man of understanding.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> Even a fool, when he keeps silent, is counted wise.<br/>
<span class="indented">When he shuts his lips, he is thought to be discerning.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 30 -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 30</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> He who loves his son will frequently discipline him,<br/>
<span class="indented">that he may rejoice in him later.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> He who chastises his son will profit by him,<br/>
<span class="indented">and will boast of him among acquaintances.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> He who teaches his son will make his enemy jealous,<br/>
<span class="indented">and will rejoice in him among friends.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> When his father dies, it is as though he is not dead;<br/>
<span class="indented">for he has left behind one like himself.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> In his life, he saw and rejoiced in him.<br/>
<span class="indented">When he died, he was not grieved.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> He has left behind him one who avenges his enemies,<br/>
<span class="indented">and repays his friends with thankfulness.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> He who makes too much of his son will bind up his wounds;<br/>
<span class="indented">his heart will be troubled at every cry.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> A horse not broken in becomes headstrong;<br/>
<span class="indented">and a child left to himself becomes willful.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Pamper your child, and he will make you afraid.<br/>
<span class="indented">Play with him, and he will grieve you.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Don’t laugh with him, lest you have sorrow with him,<br/>
<span class="indented">and you will gnash your teeth in the end.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Give him no liberty in his youth.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t ignore his thoughts.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Bow down his neck in his youth,<br/>
<span class="indented">and beat his sides while he is a child,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">lest he become stubborn, and disobey you;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and there will be sorrow to your soul.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Discipline your son, and take pains with him,<br/>
<span class="indented">lest his shameless behavior be an offense to you.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Better is a poor man who is sound and strong in constitution<br/>
<span class="indented">than a rich man who is plagued in his body.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Health and fitness are better than all gold,<br/>
<span class="indented">and a strong body than countless riches.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> There is no wealth better than health of body,<br/>
<span class="indented">and there is no gladness above the joy of the heart.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Death is better than a bitter life,<br/>
<span class="indented">and eternal rest than continual sickness.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> Good things poured out upon a mouth that is closed<br/>
<span class="indented">are like offerings of food laid upon a grave.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> What good does an offering to an idol profit?<br/>
<span class="indented">For neither can it eat nor smell.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">So is he who is afflicted by the Lord,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">seeing with his eyes and groaning,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">like a eunuch embracing a virgin and groaning.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> Don’t give your soul to sorrow.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t afflict yourself deliberately.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> Cheer up your heart, and comfort yourself.<br/>
<span class="indented">Keep sorrow far from you,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for sorrow has destroyed many,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and there is no profit in it.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> Envy and wrath shorten a man’s days.<br/>
<span class="indented">Anxiety brings old age before the time.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> A cheerful and good heart will care for his food.<br/>
<span class="indented">He will eat and enjoy it.</span> </p></section>

<h4>Psalm 84</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> How lovely are your dwellings, Lord of Armies!<br/>
<sup>2</sup> My soul longs, and even faints for the courts of the Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">My heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Yes, the sparrow has found a home,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may have her young,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">near your altars, Lord of Armies, my King, and my God.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Blessed are those who dwell in your house.<br/>
<span class="indented">They are always praising you.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Blessed are those whose strength is in you;<br/>
<span class="indented">who have set their hearts on a pilgrimage.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Passing through the valley of Weeping, they make it a place of springs.<br/>
<span class="indented">Yes, the autumn rain covers it with blessings.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> They go from strength to strength.<br/>
<span class="indented">Everyone of them appears before God in Zion.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Lord, God of Armies, hear my prayer.<br/>
<span class="indented">Listen, God of Jacob.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Behold, God our shield,<br/>

<sup>10</sup> For a day in your courts is better than a thousand.<br/>
<span class="indented">I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> For the Lord God is a sun and a shield.<br/>
<span class="indented">The Lord will give grace and glory.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He withholds no good thing from those who walk blamelessly.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Lord of Armies,<br/>

<sup>2</sup> You have forgiven the iniquity of your people.<br/>
<span class="indented">You have covered all their sin.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> You have taken away all your wrath.<br/>
<span class="indented">You have turned from the fierceness of your anger.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Turn us, God of our salvation,<br/>
<span class="indented">and cause your indignation toward us to cease.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Will you be angry with us forever?<br/>
<span class="indented">Will you draw out your anger to all generations?</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Won’t you revive us again,<br/>
<span class="indented">that your people may rejoice in you?</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Show us your loving kindness, Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">Grant us your salvation.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> I will hear what God, the Lord, will speak,<br/>
<span class="indented">for he will speak peace to his people, his saints;</span><br/>

<sup>9</sup> Surely his salvation is near those who fear him,<br/>
<span class="indented">that glory may dwell in our land.</span><br/>

<span class="indented">Righteousness has looked down from heaven.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Yes, the Lord will give that which is good.<br/>

<sup>2</sup> Preserve my soul, for I am godly.<br/>
<span class="indented">You, my God, save your servant who trusts in you.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Be merciful to me, Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">for I call to you all day long.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Bring joy to the soul of your servant,<br/>
<span class="indented">for to you, Lord, do I lift up my soul.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> For you, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive,<br/>
<span class="indented">abundant in loving kindness to all those who call on you.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Hear, Lord, my prayer.<br/>
<span class="indented">Listen to the voice of my petitions.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> In the day of my trouble I will call on you,<br/>
<span class="indented">for you will answer me.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> There is no one like you among the gods, Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor any deeds like your deeds.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> All nations you have made will come and worship before you, Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">They shall glorify your name.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> For you are great, and do wondrous things.<br/>
<span class="indented">You are God alone.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Teach me your way, Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will walk in your truth.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Make my heart undivided to fear your name.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> I will praise you, Lord my God, with my whole heart.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will glorify your name forever more.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> For your loving kindness is great toward me.<br/>
<span class="indented">You have delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> God, the proud have risen up against me.<br/>
<span class="indented">A company of violent men have sought after my soul,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and they don’t hold regard for you before them.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> But you, Lord, are a merciful and gracious God,<br/>
<span class="indented">slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness and truth.</span><br/>

<sup>17</sup> Show me a sign of your goodness,<br/>
<span class="indented">that those who hate me may see it, and be put to shame,</span><br/>

<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 18:1–12</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> An unfriendly man pursues selfishness,<br/>
<span class="indented">and defies all sound judgment.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> A fool has no delight in understanding,<br/>
<span class="indented">but only in revealing his own opinion.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> When wickedness comes, contempt also comes,<br/>
<span class="indented">and with shame comes disgrace.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> The words of a man’s mouth are like deep waters.<br/>
<span class="indented">The fountain of wisdom is like a flowing brook.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> To be partial to the faces of the wicked is not good,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor to deprive the innocent of justice.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> A fool’s lips come into strife,<br/>
<span class="indented">and his mouth invites beatings.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> A fool’s mouth is his destruction,<br/>
<span class="indented">and his lips are a snare to his soul.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> The words of a gossip are like dainty morsels:<br/>
<span class="indented">they go down into a person’s innermost parts.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> One who is slack in his work<br/>
<span class="indented">is brother to him who is a master of destruction.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> The Lord’s name is a strong tower:<br/>
<span class="indented">the righteous run to him, and are safe.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> The rich man’s wealth is his strong city,<br/>
<span class="indented">like an unscalable wall in his own imagination.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Before destruction the heart of man is proud,<br/>
<span class="indented">but before honor is humility.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 31 -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 31</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Watching for riches consumes the flesh,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the care of it drives away sleep.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Watching care will not allow slumber,<br/>
<span class="indented">as a sore disease breaks sleep.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> A rich man toils in gathering money,<br/>
<span class="indented">and when he rests, he is filled with his luxuries.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> A poor man toils in lack of substance,<br/>
<span class="indented">and when he rests, he becomes needy.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> He who loves gold will not be justified.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who follows destruction will be filled with it.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Many have been given over to ruin because of gold,<br/>
<span class="indented">and their perdition has met them face to face.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> It is a stumbling block to those who sacrifice to it.<br/>
<span class="indented">Every fool will be taken by it.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Blessed is the rich who is found blameless,<br/>
<span class="indented">and who doesn’t go after gold.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Who is he, that we may call him blessed?<br/>
<span class="indented">For he has done wonderful things among his people.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Who has been tried by it, and found perfect?<br/>
<span class="indented">Then let him glory.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Who might offend and has not offended?</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Or do evil, and has not done it?</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> His goods will be made sure.<br/>
<span class="indented">The assembly will declare his alms.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Do you sit at a great table?<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t be greedy upon it,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t say, “There is much upon it!”</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Remember that an evil eye is a bad thing.<br/>
<span class="indented">What has been created more evil than an eye?</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Therefore it sheds tears from every face.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Don’t stretch your hand wherever it looks,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t crowd your neighbor in the dish.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Judge of your neighbor’s feelings by your own;<br/>
<span class="indented">and in every matter be considerate.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Eat like a human being the things that are set before you.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t devour or you will be hated.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Be the first to stop for the sake of manners;<br/>
<span class="indented">don’t be insatiable, or you will offend.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> If you sit among many, don’t reach out your hand before they do.<br/>
<sup>19</sup> How sufficient to a well-mannered man is a little,<br/>
<span class="indented">and he does not breathe heavily on his bed.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> Healthy sleeping comes from moderate eating.<br/>
<span class="indented">He rises early, and his wits are with him.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">The pain of sleeplessness and nausea and colic are with an insatiable man.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> If you are forced to eat, arise, go out, vomit, and you will have rest.<br/>
<sup>22</sup> Listen to me, my son, and don’t despise me.<br/>
<span class="indented">In the end, you will find my words to be true.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">In all your works be quick,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and no disease will come to you.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> The generous man will bless his soul,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the merciful man will see a blessing.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> Those who are cruel to themselves, to whom will they be good?<br/>
<span class="indented">They will not rejoice in their own blessings.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> If one is mean to himself, to whom will he be generous?<br/>
<span class="indented">He will not enjoy his own riches.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> No one is worse than he who is grudging to himself.<br/>
<span class="indented">This is the punishment for his wickedness;</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> and if he does good, he does it in forgetfulness;<br/>
<span class="indented">and in the end he shows his wickedness.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> The miser’s eye is evil toward bread,<br/>
<span class="indented">and he complains in his own table.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> My son, according to what you have, do good to yourself,<br/>
<span class="indented">and offer to the Lord worthy offerings.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> Remember that death will not wait,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the covenant of Hades hasn’t been shown to you.</span><br/>
<sup>31</sup> Do good to your friend before you die,<br/>
<span class="indented">and reach out and give to him according to your ability.</span><br/>
<sup>32</sup> Don’t defraud yourself of a good day;<br/>
<span class="indented">don’t let any part of a good desire pass you by.</span><br/>
<sup>33</sup> Won’t you leave all your labors to another,<br/>
<span class="indented">and your toils to be divided by lot?</span><br/>
<sup>34</sup> Give, and take, and sanctify your soul;<br/>
<span class="indented">for there is no seeking of luxuries in the grave.</span> </p></section>

<!-- Psalms 87, 88 -->
<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 87</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> His foundation is in the holy mountains.<br/>
<sup>2</sup> The Lord loves the gates of Zion<br/>
<span class="indented">more than all the dwellings of Jacob.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Glorious things are spoken about you, city of God.<br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> I will record Rahab and Babylon among those who acknowledge me.<br/>
<span class="indented">Behold, Philistia, Tyre, and also Ethiopia:</span><br/>
<span class="indented">“This one was born there.”</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Yes, of Zion it will be said, “This one and that one was born in her,”<br/>
<span class="indented">the Most High himself will establish her.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> The Lord will count, when he writes up the peoples,<br/>
<span class="indented">“This one was born there.”</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Those who sing as well as those who dance say,<br/>
<span class="indented">“All my springs are in you.”</span> </p>
<h4>Psalm 88</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Lord, the God of my salvation,<br/>
<span class="indented">I have cried day and night before you.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Let my prayer enter into your presence.<br/>
<span class="indented">Turn your ear to my cry.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> For my soul is full of troubles.<br/>
<span class="indented">My life draws near to Sheol.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> I am counted among those who go down into the pit.<br/>
<span class="indented">I am like a man who has no help,</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> set apart among the dead,<br/>
<span class="indented">like the slain who lie in the grave,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">whom you remember no more.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">They are cut off from your hand.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> You have laid me in the lowest pit,<br/>
<span class="indented">in the darkest depths.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Your wrath lies heavily on me.<br/>
<span class="indented">You have afflicted me with all your waves.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> You have taken my friends from me.<br/>
<span class="indented">You have made me an abomination to them.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I am confined, and I can’t escape.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> My eyes are dim from grief.<br/>
<span class="indented">I have called on you daily, Lord.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I have spread out my hands to you.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Do you show wonders to the dead?<br/>
<span class="indented">Do the departed spirits rise up and praise you?</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Is your loving kindness declared in the grave?<br/>
<span class="indented">Or your faithfulness in Destruction?</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Are your wonders made known in the dark?<br/>
<span class="indented">Or your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> But to you, Lord, I have cried.<br/>
<span class="indented">In the morning, my prayer comes before you.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Lord, why do you reject my soul?<br/>
<span class="indented">Why do you hide your face from me?</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up.<br/>
<span class="indented">While I suffer your terrors, I am distracted.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Your fierce wrath has gone over me.<br/>
<span class="indented">Your terrors have cut me off.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> They came around me like water all day long.<br/>
<span class="indented">They completely engulfed me.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> You have put lover and friend far from me,<br/>
<span class="indented">and my friends into darkness.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 18:13–24 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 18:13–24</h4>
<p>
<sup>13</sup> He who answers before he hears,<br/>
<span class="indented">that is folly and shame to him.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> A man’s spirit will sustain him in sickness,<br/>
<span class="indented">but a crushed spirit, who can bear?</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> The heart of the discerning gets knowledge.<br/>
<span class="indented">The ear of the wise seeks knowledge.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> A man’s gift makes room for him,<br/>
<span class="indented">and brings him before great men.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> He who pleads his cause first seems right;<br/>
<span class="indented">until another comes and questions him.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> The lot settles disputes,<br/>
<span class="indented">and keeps strong ones apart.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> A brother offended is more difficult than a fortified city.<br/>
<span class="indented">Disputes are like the bars of a fortress.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> A man’s stomach is filled with the fruit of his mouth.<br/>
<span class="indented">With the harvest of his lips he is satisfied.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> Death and life are in the power of the tongue;<br/>
<span class="indented">those who love it will eat its fruit.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> Whoever finds a wife finds a good thing,<br/>
<span class="indented">and obtains favor of the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> The poor plead for mercy,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the rich answer harshly.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> A man of many companions may be ruined,<br/>
<span class="indented">but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 32 -->

<sup>1</sup> Have they made you ruler over a feast?<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t exalt yourself.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Be among them as one of them.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Take good care of them, and then be seated.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> When you have done all your duties, take your place,<br/>
<span class="indented">that you may be merry with them,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and receive a crown for your well ordering.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Speak, you who are older, for it is proper to you,<br/>
<span class="indented">but with sound knowledge,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t interrupt the music.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Where there is no one who listens, don’t pour out talk.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t show off your wisdom out of time.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> A concert of music in a banquet of wine is like a signet of emerald set in gold.<br/>
<sup>6</sup> A concert of music in a banquet of wine is like a seal of emerald set in gold.<br/>
<sup>7</sup> Speak, you who are young, if you are obliged,<br/>
<span class="indented">and not more than twice, and only if asked.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Summarize your speech. Many things in few words.<br/>
<span class="indented">Be as one who knows and yet holds his tongue.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Don’t be hasty in your words in a crowd.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t lay your wisdom out of place.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> A ruby seal on a precious stone is a concert of music in a banquet of wine.<br/>
<sup>11</sup> Speak, young man, if there is need of you;<br/>
<span class="indented">yet scarcely when you are twice asked.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Summarize your speech. Many things in few words.<br/>
<span class="indented">Be as one who knows and yet is silent.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> In company of great men, don’t be forward.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t speak much.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Lightning goes before thunder.<br/>
<span class="indented">Favor goes before a modest man.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Rise up early, and don’t be the last;<br/>
<span class="indented">get home quickly without delay.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> There take your pastime,<br/>
<span class="indented">and do what is in your heart;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">but don’t sin by proud speech.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Above all, bless your Maker,<br/>
<span class="indented">who fills you with his good gifts.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> He who fears the Lord will receive his discipline.<br/>
<span class="indented">Those who seek him early will find favor.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> He who seeks the law will be filled with it,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the hypocrite will stumble at it.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> Those who fear the Lord will find judgment,<br/>
<span class="indented">and will kindle righteous acts like a light.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> A sinful man shuns reproof,<br/>
<span class="indented">and finds an excuse according to his will.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> A man of counsel will not neglect thought;<br/>
<span class="indented">a strange and proud man will not be daunted by fear.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Do nothing without counsel;<br/>
<span class="indented">and when you have done it, don’t be sorry.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> Don’t go in a way of conflict,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t stumble at the stones.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> Don’t trust on a smooth road,<br/>
<span class="indented">and be careful in your paths.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> And be aware of your children, and heed them,<br/>
<span class="indented">and watch over them with sure discipline.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> He who trusts the law gives heed to the commandments.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who trusts the Lord will never suffer loss.</span> </p></section>

<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 89</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> I will sing of the loving kindness of the Lord forever.<br/>
<span class="indented">With my mouth, I will make known your faithfulness to all generations.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> I indeed declare, “Love stands firm forever.<br/>
<span class="indented">You established the heavens.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Your faithfulness is in them.”</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> “I have made a covenant with my chosen one.<br/>
<span class="indented">I have sworn to David, my servant,</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> ‘I will establish your offspring forever,<br/>
<span class="indented">and build up your throne to all generations.’”</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> The heavens will praise your wonders, Lord;<br/>
<span class="indented">your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> For who in the skies can be compared to the Lord?<br/>
<span class="indented">Who among the sons of the heavenly beings is like the Lord,</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> a very awesome God in the council of the holy ones,<br/>
<span class="indented">to be feared above all those who are around him?</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Lord, God of Armies, who is a mighty one, like you?<br/>
<span class="indented">The Lord, your faithfulness is around you.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> You rule the pride of the sea.<br/>
<span class="indented">When its waves rise up, you calm them.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> You have broken Rahab in pieces, like one of the slain.<br/>
<span class="indented">You have scattered your enemies with your mighty arm.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> The heavens are yours. The earth also is yours,<br/>
<span class="indented">the world and its fullness. You have founded them.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> You have created the north and the south.<br/>
<span class="indented">Tabor and Hermon rejoice in your name.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> You have a mighty arm.<br/>
<span class="indented">Your hand is strong, and your right hand is exalted.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne.<br/>
<span class="indented">Loving kindness and truth go before your face.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Blessed are the people who learn to acclaim you.<br/>
<span class="indented">They walk in the light of your presence, Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> In your name they rejoice all day.<br/>
<span class="indented">In your righteousness, they are exalted.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> For you are the glory of their strength.<br/>
<span class="indented">In your favor, our horn will be exalted.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> For our shield belongs to the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">our king to the Holy One of Israel.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> Then you spoke in vision to your saints,<br/>
<span class="indented">and said, “I have given strength to the warrior.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I have exalted a young man from the people.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> I have found David, my servant.<br/>
<span class="indented">I have anointed him with my holy oil,</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> with whom my hand shall be established.<br/>
<span class="indented">My arm will also strengthen him.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> No enemy will tax him.<br/>
<span class="indented">No wicked man will oppress him.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> I will beat down his adversaries before him,<br/>
<span class="indented">and strike those who hate him.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> But my faithfulness and my loving kindness will be with him.<br/>
<span class="indented">In my name, his horn will be exalted.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> I will set his hand also on the sea,<br/>
<span class="indented">and his right hand on the rivers.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> He will call to me, ‘You are my Father,<br/>
<span class="indented">my God, and the rock of my salvation!’</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> I will also appoint him my firstborn,<br/>
<span class="indented">the highest of the kings of the earth.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> I will keep my loving kindness for him forever more.<br/>
<span class="indented">My covenant will stand firm with him.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> I will also make his offspring endure forever,<br/>
<span class="indented">and his throne as the days of heaven.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> If his children forsake my law,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t walk in my ordinances;</span><br/>
<sup>31</sup> if they break my statutes,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t keep my commandments;</span><br/>
<sup>32</sup> then I will punish their sin with the rod,<br/>
<span class="indented">and their iniquity with stripes.</span><br/>
<sup>33</sup> But I will not completely take my loving kindness from him,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor allow my faithfulness to fail.</span><br/>
<sup>34</sup> I will not break my covenant,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor alter what my lips have uttered.</span><br/>
<sup>35</sup> Once I have sworn by my holiness,<br/>
<span class="indented">I will not lie to David.</span><br/>
<sup>36</sup> His offspring will endure forever,<br/>
<span class="indented">his throne like the sun before me.</span><br/>
<sup>37</sup> It will be established forever like the moon,<br/>
<span class="indented">the faithful witness in the sky.”</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>38</sup> But you have rejected and spurned.<br/>
<span class="indented">You have been angry with your anointed.</span><br/>
<sup>39</sup> You have renounced the covenant of your servant.<br/>
<span class="indented">You have defiled his crown in the dust.</span><br/>
<sup>40</sup> You have broken down all his hedges.<br/>
<span class="indented">You have brought his strongholds to ruin.</span><br/>
<sup>41</sup> All who pass by the way rob him.<br/>
<span class="indented">He has become a reproach to his neighbors.</span><br/>
<sup>42</sup> You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries.<br/>
<span class="indented">You have made all of his enemies rejoice.</span><br/>
<sup>43</sup> Yes, you turn back the edge of his sword,<br/>
<span class="indented">and haven’t supported him in battle.</span><br/>
<sup>44</sup> You have ended his splendor,<br/>
<span class="indented">and thrown his throne down to the ground.</span><br/>
<sup>45</sup> You have shortened the days of his youth.<br/>
<span class="indented">You have covered him with shame.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>46</sup> How long, Lord?<br/>
<span class="indented">Will you hide yourself forever?</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Will your wrath burn like fire?</span><br/>
<sup>47</sup> Remember how short my time is;<br/>
<span class="indented">for what vanity you have created all the children of men!</span><br/>
<sup>48</sup> What man is he who shall live and not see death,<br/>
<span class="indented">who shall deliver his soul from the power of Sheol?</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>49</sup> Lord, where are your former loving kindnesses,<br/>
<span class="indented">which you swore to David in your faithfulness?</span><br/>
<sup>50</sup> Remember, Lord, the reproach of your servants,<br/>
<span class="indented">how I bear in my heart the taunts of all the mighty peoples,</span><br/>
<sup>51</sup> With which your enemies have mocked, Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">with which they have mocked the footsteps of your anointed one.</span><br/>
<sup>52</sup> Blessed be the Lord forever more.<br/>
<span class="indented">Amen and Amen.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 19:1–14 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 19:1–14</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Better is the poor who walks in integrity<br/>
<span class="indented">than he who is perverse in his lips and is a fool.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> It isn’t good to have zeal without knowledge,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor being hasty with one’s feet and missing the way.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> The foolishness of man subverts his way;<br/>
<span class="indented">his heart rages against the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Wealth adds many friends,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the poor is separated from his friend.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> A false witness shall not be unpunished.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who pours out lies shall not go free.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Many will entreat the favor of a ruler,<br/>
<span class="indented">and everyone is a friend to a man who gives gifts.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> All the relatives of the poor shun him.<br/>
<span class="indented">How much more do his friends avoid him?</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He pursues them with pleas, but they are gone.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> He who gets wisdom loves his own soul.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who keeps understanding shall find good.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> A false witness shall not be unpunished.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who utters lies shall perish.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Delicate living is not appropriate for a fool,<br/>
<span class="indented">much less for a servant to have rule over princes.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> The discretion of a man makes him slow to anger.<br/>
<span class="indented">It is his glory to overlook an offense.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> The king’s wrath is like the roaring of a lion,<br/>
<span class="indented">but his favor is like dew on the grass.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> A foolish son is the calamity of his father.<br/>
<span class="indented">A wife’s quarrels are a continual dripping.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> House and riches are an inheritance from fathers,<br/>
<span class="indented">but a prudent wife is from the Lord.</span> </p> <!-- (No Sirach reading for Day 35) -->

<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 90</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Lord, you have been our dwelling place<br/>
<span class="indented">for all generations.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Before the mountains were brought forth,<br/>
<span class="indented">before you had formed the earth and the world,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">even from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> You turn man to destruction, saying,<br/>
<span class="indented">“Return, you children of men.”</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> For a thousand years in your sight<br/>
<span class="indented">are just like yesterday when it is past,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">like a watch in the night.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> You sweep them away as they sleep.<br/>
<span class="indented">In the morning they sprout like new grass.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> In the morning it sprouts and springs up.<br/>
<span class="indented">By evening it is withered and dry.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> For we are consumed in your anger.<br/>
<span class="indented">We are troubled in your wrath.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> You have set our iniquities before you,<br/>
<span class="indented">our secret sins in the light of your presence.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> For all our days have passed away in your wrath.<br/>
<span class="indented">We bring our years to an end as a sigh.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> The days of our years are seventy,<br/>
<span class="indented">or even by reason of strength eighty years;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">yet their pride is but labor and sorrow,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for it passes quickly, and we fly away.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Who knows the power of your anger,<br/>
<span class="indented">your wrath according to the fear that is due to you?</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> So teach us to number our days,<br/>
<span class="indented">that we may gain a heart of wisdom.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Relent, Lord! How long?<br/>
<span class="indented">Have compassion on your servants!</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Satisfy us in the morning with your loving kindness,<br/>
<span class="indented">that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us,<br/>
<span class="indented">for as many years as we have seen evil.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Let your work appear to your servants,<br/>
<span class="indented">your glory to their children.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Let the favor of the Lord our God be on us.<br/>
<span class="indented">Establish the work of our hands for us.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Yes, establish the work of our hands.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 91</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High<br/>
<span class="indented">will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> I will say of the Lord, “He is my refuge and my fortress;<br/>
<span class="indented">my God, in whom I trust.”</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler,<br/>
<span class="indented">and from the deadly pestilence.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> He will cover you with his feathers.<br/>
<span class="indented">Under his wings you will take refuge.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">His faithfulness is your shield and rampart.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> You shall not be afraid of the terror by night,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor of the arrow that flies by day,</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor of the destruction that wastes at noonday.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> A thousand may fall at your side,<br/>
<span class="indented">and ten thousand at your right hand;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">but it will not come near you.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> You will only look with your eyes,<br/>
<span class="indented">and see the recompense of the wicked.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Because you have made the Lord your refuge,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the Most High your dwelling place,</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> no evil shall happen to you,<br/>
<span class="indented">neither shall any plague come near your dwelling.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> For he will put his angels in charge of you,<br/>
<span class="indented">to guard you in all your ways.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> They will bear you up in their hands,<br/>
<span class="indented">so that you won’t dash your foot against a stone.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> You will tread on the lion and cobra.<br/>
<span class="indented">You will trample the young lion and the serpent underfoot.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> “Because he has set his love on me, therefore I will deliver him.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will set him on high, because he has known my name.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> He will call on me, and I will answer him.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will be with him in trouble.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I will deliver him, and honor him.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> I will satisfy him with long life,<br/>
<span class="indented">and show him my salvation.”</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 92</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> It is a good thing to give thanks to the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">to sing praises to your name, Most High;</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> to proclaim your loving kindness in the morning,<br/>
<span class="indented">and your faithfulness every night,</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> with the ten-stringed lute, with the harp,<br/>
<span class="indented">and with the melody of the lyre.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> For you, Lord, have made me glad through your work.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will triumph in the works of your hands.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> How great are your works, Lord!<br/>
<span class="indented">Your thoughts are very deep.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> A senseless man doesn’t know,<br/>
<span class="indented">neither does a fool understand this:</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> though the wicked spring up like grass,<br/>
<span class="indented">and all evildoers flourish,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">they will be destroyed forever.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> But you, Lord, are on high forever more.<br/>
<sup>9</sup> For behold, your enemies, Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">for behold, your enemies shall perish.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">All the evildoers will be scattered.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> But you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox.<br/>
<span class="indented">I am anointed with fresh oil.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> My eye has also seen my enemies.<br/>
<span class="indented">My ears have heard of the wicked enemies who rise up against me.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree.<br/>
<span class="indented">He will grow like a cedar in Lebanon.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> They are planted in the Lord’s house.<br/>
<span class="indented">They will flourish in our God’s courts.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> They will still produce fruit in old age.<br/>
<span class="indented">They will be full of sap and green,</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> to show that the Lord is upright.<br/>
<span class="indented">He is my rock,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and there is no unrighteousness in him.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 19:15–29 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 19:15–29</h4>
<p>
<sup>15</sup> Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep.<br/>
<span class="indented">The idle soul shall suffer hunger.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> He who keeps the commandment keeps his soul,<br/>
<span class="indented">but he who is contemptuous in his ways shall die.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> He who has pity on the poor lends to the Lord;<br/>
<span class="indented">he will reward him.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> Discipline your son, for there is hope;<br/>
<span class="indented">don’t be a willing party to his death.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> A hot-tempered man must pay the penalty,<br/>
<span class="indented">for if you rescue him, you must do it again.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> Listen to counsel and receive instruction,<br/>
<span class="indented">that you may be wise in your latter end.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> There are many plans in a man’s heart,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the Lord’s counsel will prevail.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> That which makes a man to be desired is his kindness.<br/>
<span class="indented">A poor man is better than a liar.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> The fear of the Lord leads to life, then contentment;<br/>
<span class="indented">he rests and will not be touched by trouble.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> The sluggard buries his hand in the dish;<br/>
<span class="indented">he will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> Flog a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence;<br/>
<span class="indented">rebuke one who has understanding, and he will gain knowledge.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> He who robs his father and drives away his mother<br/>
<span class="indented">is a son who causes shame and brings reproach.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> If you stop listening to instruction, my son,<br/>
<span class="indented">you will stray from the words of knowledge.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> A corrupt witness mocks justice,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the mouth of the wicked gulps down iniquity.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> Penalties are prepared for scoffers,<br/>
<span class="indented">and beatings for the backs of fools.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 33 -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 33</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> No evil will happen to him who fears the Lord;<br/>
<span class="indented">but in temptation, once and again he will deliver him.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> A wise man won’t hate the law,<br/>
<span class="indented">but he who is a hypocrite about it is like a ship in a storm.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> A man of understanding will put his trust in the law.<br/>
<span class="indented">The law is as dependable to him as an inquiry by Urim.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Prepare your speech, and so you will be heard.<br/>
<span class="indented">Bind up instruction, and make your answer.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> The heart of a fool is like a cartwheel;<br/>
<span class="indented">and his thoughts like a rolling axle.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> A stallion horse is like a mocking friend;<br/>
<span class="indented">he neighs under everyone who sits on him.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Why does one day excel another,<br/>
<span class="indented">when all the light of every day in the year is of the sun?</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> By the Lord’s wisdom they were distinguished;<br/>
<span class="indented">and he varied the seasons and festivals.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Some of them he exalted and hallowed,<br/>
<span class="indented">and some of them he made ordinary days.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> All men are from the ground,<br/>
<span class="indented">and Adam was created of earth.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> In the fullness of knowledge the Lord distinguished them,<br/>
<span class="indented">and made their ways various.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Some of them he blessed and lifted up,<br/>
<span class="indented">and some of them he hallowed and brought near to himself.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Some of them he cursed and brought low,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and overthrew them from their place.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Like clay in the hand of the potter,<br/>
<span class="indented">all his ways are according to his good pleasure;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">so men in the hand of him who made them,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">to render to them according to his judgment.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Good is set against evil,<br/>
<span class="indented">and life against death;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">so the sinner against the godly.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> So look upon all the works of the Most High:<br/>
<span class="indented">two and two, one against another.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> I awakened up last, like one who gathers after the grape gatherers.<br/>
<span class="indented">By the blessing of the Lord I profited,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and filled my winepress like one who gathers grapes.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Consider that I haven’t labored for myself only,<br/>
<span class="indented">but for all those who seek instruction.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> Hear me, you great men of the people,<br/>
<span class="indented">and hearken with your ears, you rulers of the congregation.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> To son or wife, to brother or friend,<br/>
<span class="indented">don’t give power over yourself while you live.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t give your goods to another,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">lest you ask for them again and not get them.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> As long as you live and have breath in you,<br/>
<span class="indented">don’t give yourself over to anybody.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> For it is better that your children should ask of you,<br/>
<span class="indented">than that you should look toward the hand of your sons.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> In all your works keep the upper hand.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t stain your honor.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> In the day that you end the days of your life,<br/>
<span class="indented">in the time of death, distribute your inheritance.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> Fodder, a rod, and burdens are for the donkey;<br/>
<span class="indented">bread, discipline, and work for a servant.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> Set your servant to work, and you will find rest.<br/>
<span class="indented">Leave his hands idle, and he will seek liberty.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> Yoke and thong will bow the neck;<br/>
<span class="indented">and for an evil servant, there are racks and tortures.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> Send him to labor, that he not be idle;<br/>
<span class="indented">for idleness teaches much evil.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> Set him to work, as is fitting for him.<br/>
<span class="indented">If he doesn’t obey, make his fetters heavy.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">But don’t be excessive toward anyone,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t do anything without judgment.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> If you have a servant, let him be as yourself,<br/>
<span class="indented">because you have bought him with blood.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> If you have a servant, treat him as a brother,<br/>
<span class="indented">for you need him as for your own soul.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">If you treat him badly, and he runs away,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">which way will you go to seek him?</span> </p></section>

<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 93</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> The Lord reigns! He is clothed with majesty!<br/>
<span class="indented">The Lord is armed with strength.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">The world also is established.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">It can’t be moved.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Your throne is established from long ago.<br/>
<span class="indented">You are from everlasting.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> The floods have lifted up, Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">the floods have lifted up their voice.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">The floods lift up their waves.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Above the voices of many waters,<br/>
<span class="indented">the mighty breakers of the sea,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">the Lord on high is mighty.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Your statutes stand firm.<br/>
<span class="indented">Holiness adorns your house,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Lord, forever more.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 94</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> The Lord is a God who avenges.<br/>
<span class="indented">God who avenges, shine out.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Rise up, you judge of the earth.<br/>
<span class="indented">Pay back the proud what they deserve.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Lord, how long will the wicked,<br/>
<span class="indented">how long will the wicked triumph?</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> They pour out arrogant words.<br/>
<span class="indented">All the evildoers boast.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> They break your people in pieces, Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">and afflict your heritage.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> They kill the widow and the alien,<br/>
<span class="indented">and murder the fatherless.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> They say, “The Lord will not see,<br/>
<span class="indented">neither will Jacob’s God consider.”</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Consider, you senseless among the people;<br/>
<span class="indented">you fools, when will you be wise?</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> He who implanted the ear, won’t he hear?<br/>
<span class="indented">He who formed the eye, won’t he see?</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> He who disciplines the nations, won’t he punish?<br/>
<span class="indented">He who teaches man knows.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> The Lord knows the thoughts of man,<br/>
<span class="indented">that they are futile.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Blessed is the man whom you discipline, Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">and teach out of your law,</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> that you may give him rest from the days of adversity,<br/>
<span class="indented">until the pit is dug for the wicked.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> For the Lord won’t reject his people,<br/>
<span class="indented">neither will he forsake his inheritance.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> For judgment will return to righteousness.<br/>
<span class="indented">All the upright in heart shall follow it.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Who will rise up for me against the wicked?<br/>
<span class="indented">Who will stand up for me against the evildoers?</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Unless the Lord had been my help,<br/>
<span class="indented">my soul would have soon lived in silence.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> When I said, “My foot is slipping!”<br/>
<span class="indented">Your loving kindness, Lord, held me up.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> In the multitude of my thoughts within me,<br/>
<span class="indented">your comforts delight my soul.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with you,<br/>
<span class="indented">which brings about mischief by statute?</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous,<br/>
<span class="indented">and condemn the innocent blood.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> But the Lord has been my high tower;<br/>
<span class="indented">my God, the rock of my refuge.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> He has brought on them their own iniquity,<br/>
<span class="indented">and will cut them off in their own wickedness.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">The Lord our God will cut them off.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 95</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Oh come, let’s sing to the Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let’s shout aloud to the rock of our salvation!</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Let’s come before his presence with thanksgiving.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let’s extol him with songs!</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> For the Lord is a great God,<br/>
<span class="indented">a great King above all gods.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> In his hand are the deep places of the earth.<br/>
<span class="indented">The heights of the mountains are also his.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> The sea is his, and he made it.<br/>
<span class="indented">His hands formed the dry land.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Oh come, let’s worship and bow down.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let’s kneel before the Lord, our Maker,</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> for he is our God.<br/>
<span class="indented">We are the people of his pasture,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and the sheep in his care.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Today, oh that you would hear his voice!</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Don’t harden your heart, as at Meribah,<br/>
<span class="indented">as in the day of Massah in the wilderness,</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> when your fathers tempted me,<br/>
<span class="indented">tested me, and saw my work.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Forty long years I was grieved with that generation, and said,<br/>
<span class="indented">“It is a people that errs in their heart.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">They have not known my ways.”</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Therefore I swore in my wrath,<br/>
<span class="indented">“They won’t enter into my rest.”</span> </p>
<!-- Proverbs 20:1–15 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 20:1–15</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Wine is a mocker and beer is a brawler.<br/>
<span class="indented">Whoever is led astray by them is not wise.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> The terror of a king is like the roaring of a lion.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who provokes him to anger forfeits his own life.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife,<br/>
<span class="indented">but every fool will be quarreling.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> The sluggard will not plow by reason of the winter;<br/>
<span class="indented">therefore he shall beg in harvest, and have nothing.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water,<br/>
<span class="indented">but a man of understanding will draw it out.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Many men claim to be men of unfailing love,<br/>
<span class="indented">but who can find a faithful man?</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> A righteous man walks in integrity.<br/>
<span class="indented">Blessed are his children after him.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> A king who sits on the throne of judgment<br/>
<span class="indented">scatters away all evil with his eyes.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Who can say, “I have made my heart pure.<br/>
<span class="indented">I am clean and without sin?”</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Differing weights and differing measures,<br/>
<span class="indented">both of them alike are an abomination to the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Even a child makes himself known by his doings,<br/>
<span class="indented">whether his work is pure, and whether it is right.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> The hearing ear, and the seeing eye,<br/>
<span class="indented">the Lord has made even both of them.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Don’t love sleep, lest you come to poverty.<br/>
<span class="indented">Open your eyes, and you shall be satisfied with bread.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> “It’s no good, it’s no good,” says the buyer;<br/>
<span class="indented">but when he has gone his way, then he boasts.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> There is gold and abundance of rubies;<br/>
<span class="indented">but the lips of knowledge are a rare jewel.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 34 -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 34</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Vain and false hopes are for a man void of understanding;<br/>
<span class="indented">and dreams give wings to fools.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> As one who catches at a shadow and follows after the wind,<br/>
<span class="indented">so is he who sets his mind on dreams.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> The vision of dreams is like a reflection of a face in a mirror;<br/>
<span class="indented">the likeness of a face against a face.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> From an unclean thing what will be cleansed?<br/>
<span class="indented">From that which is false what will be true?</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Divinations, and soothsayings, and dreams, are vain;<br/>
<span class="indented">and the heart fancies, as a woman’s in travail.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> If they are not sent from the Most High in your visitation,<br/>
<span class="indented">don’t give your heart to them.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> For dreams have led many astray.<br/>
<span class="indented">They have failed by putting their hope in them.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Without deceit the law will be fulfilled,<br/>
<span class="indented">and wisdom is perfection to a faithful mouth.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> A well-instructed man knows many things;<br/>
<span class="indented">and one with much experience will declare understanding.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> He who has no experience knows few things;<br/>
<span class="indented">but he who has traveled will increase delicacy.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> I have seen many things in my travels,<br/>
<span class="indented">and I understand more than I can express.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> I was often in danger of death,<br/>
<span class="indented">but I was delivered because of these things.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> The spirit of those who fear the Lord shall live,<br/>
<span class="indented">for their hope is in him who saves them.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> He who fears the Lord won’t be afraid,<br/>
<span class="indented">and he will not play the coward, for he is his hope.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Blessed is the soul of him who fears the Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">To whom does he look? Who is his support?</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> The eyes of the Lord are upon those who love him;<br/>
<span class="indented">he is their mighty protection and strong support,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">a cover from the scorching wind, and a cover from the noonday sun,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">a guard from stumbling, and a help from falling.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> He raises up the soul, and enlightens the eyes.<br/>
<span class="indented">He gives health, life, and blessing.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> He who sacrifices a thing wrongfully gotten,<br/>
<span class="indented">his offering is made in mockery.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">The gifts of the lawless are not accepted.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> The Most High is not pleased with the offerings of the ungodly;<br/>
<span class="indented">neither is he pacified for sins by the multitude of sacrifices.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> He who offers a sacrifice of the goods of the poor<br/>
<span class="indented">is like one who kills the son before his father’s eyes.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> The bread of the needy is the life of the poor;<br/>
<span class="indented">he who deprives him of it is a man of blood.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> He who takes away his neighbor’s living slays him;<br/>
<span class="indented">and he who defrauds the laborer of his hire is a bloodshedder.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> When one builds, and another pulls down,<br/>
<span class="indented">what profit do they have but labor?</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> When one prays, and another curses,<br/>
<span class="indented">whose voice will the Lord listen to?</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> He who washes himself after touching a dead body, then touches it again,<br/>
<span class="indented">what did he gain by his washing?</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> Even so a man who fasts for his sins,<br/>
<span class="indented">and goes again and does the same,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">who will listen to his prayer?</span><br/>
<span class="indented">What profit does he get in humbling himself?</span> </p></section>

<span class="indented">He delivers them out of the hand of the wicked.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Light is sown for the righteous,<br/>
<span class="indented">and gladness for the upright in heart.</span><br/>

<span class="indented">Give thanks to his holy name.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 20:16–30 -->

<h4>Proverbs 20:16–30</h4>
<p>
<sup>16</sup> Take the garment of one who puts up collateral for a stranger;<br/>
<span class="indented">and hold him in pledge for a wayward woman.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Fraudulent food is sweet to a man,<br/>
<span class="indented">but afterwards his mouth is filled with gravel.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> Plans are established by advice;<br/>
<span class="indented">by wise guidance you wage war!</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> He who goes about as a tale-bearer reveals secrets;<br/>
<span class="indented">therefore don’t keep company with him who opens wide his lips.</span><br/>

<span class="indented">his lamp shall be put out in blackness of darkness.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> An inheritance quickly gained at the beginning<br/>

<sup>22</sup> Don’t say, “I will pay back evil.”<br/>
<span class="indented">Wait for the Lord, and he will save you.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> The Lord detests differing weights,<br/>
<span class="indented">and dishonest scales are not pleasing.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> A man’s steps are from the Lord;<br/>
<span class="indented">how then can man understand his way?</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> It is a snare to a man to make a rash dedication,<br/>
<span class="indented">then later to consider his vows.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> A wise king winnows out the wicked,<br/>
<span class="indented">and drives the threshing wheel over them.</span><br/>

<p>
<sup>1</sup> He who keeps the law multiplies offerings.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who heeds the commandments sacrifices a peace offering.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> He who repays a good turn offers fine flour,<br/>
<span class="indented">and he who gives alms sacrifices a thank offering.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> To depart from wickedness pleases the Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">To depart from unrighteousness is an atoning sacrifice.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Don’t appear before the Lord empty.<br/>
<sup>5</sup> Do this because of the commandment.<br/>
<sup>6</sup> The offering of a righteous man enriches the altar.<br/>
<span class="indented">Its fragrance comes up before the Most High.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> The sacrifice of a righteous man is acceptable.<br/>
<span class="indented">It won’t be forgotten.</span><br/>

<span class="indented">for he will not accept them.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t trust to an unrighteous sacrifice,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for the Lord is a judge,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and with him is no partiality.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> He will not show partiality against a poor man,<br/>
<span class="indented">but he will listen to the prayer of him who is wronged.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> He will not ignore the supplication of the fatherless,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor the widow when she pours out her complaint.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Don’t the tears run down her cheeks?<br/>
<span class="indented">And is not her cry against him who caused them to fall?</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> He who serves God according to his good pleasure will be accepted.<br/>
<span class="indented">His prayer will reach to the clouds.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> The prayer of the humble pierces the clouds.<br/>
<span class="indented">Until it comes near, he will not be comforted.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He will not depart until the Most High answers,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and judges righteously, and executes judgment.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> The Lord will not be slow,<br/>

<span class="indented">His right hand, and his holy arm, have worked salvation for him.</span><br/>

<sup>6</sup> Moses and Aaron were among his priests,<br/>

<span class="indented">His loving kindness endures forever,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">his faithfulness to all generations.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 101</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> I will sing of loving kindness and justice.<br/>
<span class="indented">To you, Lord, I will sing praises.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> I will be careful to live a blameless life.<br/>
<span class="indented">When will you come to me?</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I will walk within my house with a blameless heart.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> I will set no vile thing before my eyes.<br/>
<span class="indented">I hate the deeds of faithless men.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">They will not cling to me.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> A perverse heart will be far from me.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will have nothing to do with evil.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> I will silence whoever secretly slanders his neighbor.<br/>
<span class="indented">I won’t tolerate one who is arrogant and conceited.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> My eyes will be on the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who walks in a perfect way, he will serve me.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> He who practices deceit won’t dwell within my house.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who speaks falsehood won’t be established before my eyes.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Morning by morning, I will destroy all the wicked of the land,<br/>
<span class="indented">to cut off all the workers of iniquity from the Lord’s city.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 21:1–15 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 21:1–15</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> The king’s heart is in the Lord’s hand like the watercourses.<br/>
<span class="indented">He turns it wherever he desires.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Every way of a man is right in his own eyes,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the Lord weighs the hearts.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> To do righteousness and justice<br/>
<span class="indented">is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> A high look and a proud heart—<br/>
<span class="indented">the lamp of the wicked—is sin.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> The plans of the diligent surely lead to profit;<br/>
<span class="indented">and everyone who is hasty surely rushes to poverty.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Getting treasures by a lying tongue<br/>
<span class="indented">is a fleeting vapor for those who seek death.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> The violence of the wicked will drive them away,<br/>
<span class="indented">because they refuse to do what is right.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> The way of the guilty is devious,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the conduct of the innocent is upright.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop<br/>
<span class="indented">than to share a house with a contentious woman.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> The soul of the wicked desires evil;<br/>
<span class="indented">his neighbor finds no mercy in his eyes.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> When the mocker is punished, the simple gains wisdom.<br/>
<span class="indented">When the wise is instructed, he receives knowledge.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> The Righteous One considers the house of the wicked,<br/>
<span class="indented">and brings the wicked to ruin.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Whoever stops his ears at the cry of the poor,<br/>
<span class="indented">he will also cry out, but shall not be heard.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> A gift in secret pacifies anger;<br/>
<span class="indented">and a bribe in the cloak, strong wrath.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> It is joy to the righteous to do justice,<br/>
<span class="indented">but it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 36 -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 36</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Have mercy upon us, O Lord, the God of all, and behold;<br/>
<sup>2</sup> and send your fear upon all the nations.<br/>
<sup>3</sup> Lift up your hand against the foreign nations,<br/>
<span class="indented">that they may see your mighty power.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> As you were sanctified in us before them,<br/>
<span class="indented">so be you magnified among them before us.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Let them know you, as we have known you,<br/>
<span class="indented">that there is no God but you, O God.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Show new signs, and make more wonders;<br/>
<span class="indented">glorify your hand and your right arm.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Raise up your indignation, and pour out wrath;<br/>
<span class="indented">take away the adversary, and destroy the enemy.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Speedily give an end to the time, remember the covenant,<br/>
<span class="indented">that they may declare your mighty deeds.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Let him who escapes be devoured by the rage of fire;<br/>
<span class="indented">let those who harm your people perish.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Crush the heads of the rulers of the enemies,<br/>
<span class="indented">who say, “There is no one but we.”</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Gather all the tribes of Jacob together,<br/>
<span class="indented">and inherit them as from the beginning.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> O Lord, have mercy upon the people that is called by your name,<br/>
<span class="indented">and upon Israel, whom you named your firstborn.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Be merciful to Jerusalem, the city of your sanctuary,<br/>
<span class="indented">the place of your rest.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Fill Zion with your majesty,<br/>
<span class="indented">and your temple with your glory.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Give testimony to those who were your creatures in the beginning,<br/>
<span class="indented">and fulfill the prophecies that have been spoken in your name.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Give reward to those who wait for you,<br/>
<span class="indented">and men will put their trust in your prophets.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Hear the prayer of your servants,<br/>
<span class="indented">according to the blessing of Aaron concerning your people;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and all those who are on the earth will know</span><br/>
<span class="indented">that you are the Lord, the eternal God.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> The belly will eat any kind of food,<br/>
<span class="indented">yet one food is better than another.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> As the palate tastes the flavors of venison,<br/>
<span class="indented">so does a skillful heart discern false speeches.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> A perverse heart will cause heaviness,<br/>
<span class="indented">but a man of experience will repay him.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> A woman will receive any man,<br/>
<span class="indented">but one daughter is better than another.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> The beauty of a woman makes her face shine,<br/>
<span class="indented">and above all desire she is desired.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> If there is on her tongue mercy and meekness,<br/>
<span class="indented">her husband is not like the sons of men.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> He who gets a wife enters upon a possession,<br/>
<span class="indented">a help like himself, and a pillar of rest.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> Where no hedge is, the property is plundered.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who has no wife will wander, mourning.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> Who will trust a well-equipped robber,<br/>
<span class="indented">who skips from city to city?</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Likewise a man who has no nest,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and lodges wherever night overtakes him.</span> </p></section>

<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 102</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Hear my prayer, Lord!<br/>
<span class="indented">Let my cry come to you.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Don’t hide your face from me in the day of my distress.<br/>
<span class="indented">Turn your ear to me.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Answer me quickly in the day when I call.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> For my days consume away like smoke.<br/>
<span class="indented">My bones are burned as a torch.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> My heart is blighted like grass, and withered;<br/>
<span class="indented">for I forget to eat my bread.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> By reason of the voice of my groaning,<br/>
<span class="indented">my bones stick to my skin.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> I am like a pelican of the wilderness.<br/>
<span class="indented">I have become as an owl of the waste places.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> I watch, and have become like a sparrow that is alone on the housetop.<br/>
<sup>8</sup> My enemies reproach me all day.<br/>
<span class="indented">Those who are mad at me use my name as a curse.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> For I have eaten ashes like bread,<br/>
<span class="indented">and mixed my drink with tears,</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> because of your indignation and your wrath;<br/>
<span class="indented">for you have taken me up, and thrown me away.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> My days are like a long shadow.<br/>
<span class="indented">I have withered like grass.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> But you, Lord, will remain forever;<br/>
<span class="indented">your renown endures to all generations.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> You will arise and have mercy on Zion;<br/>
<span class="indented">for it is time to have pity on her.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Yes, the set time has come.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> For your servants take pleasure in her stones,<br/>
<span class="indented">and have pity on her dust.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> So the nations will fear the Lord’s name,<br/>
<span class="indented">all the kings of the earth your glory.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> For the Lord has built up Zion.<br/>
<span class="indented">He has appeared in his glory.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> He has responded to the prayer of the destitute,<br/>
<span class="indented">and has not despised their prayer.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> This will be written for the generation to come.<br/>
<span class="indented">A people which will be created will praise the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> For he has looked down from the height of his sanctuary.<br/>
<span class="indented">From heaven, the Lord saw the earth;</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> to hear the groans of the prisoner;<br/>
<span class="indented">to free those who are condemned to death;</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> that men may declare the Lord’s name in Zion,<br/>
<span class="indented">and his praise in Jerusalem;</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> when the peoples are gathered together,<br/>
<span class="indented">the kingdoms, to serve the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> He weakened my strength along the course.<br/>
<span class="indented">He shortened my days.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> I said, “My God, don’t take me away in the middle of my days.<br/>
<span class="indented">Your years are throughout all generations.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> Of old, you laid the foundation of the earth.<br/>
<span class="indented">The heavens are the work of your hands.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> They will perish, but you will endure.<br/>
<span class="indented">Yes, all of them will wear out like a garment.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">You will change them like a cloak, and they will be changed.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> But you are the same.<br/>
<span class="indented">Your years will have no end.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> The children of your servants will continue.<br/>
<span class="indented">Their offspring will be established before you.”</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 103</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Praise the Lord, my soul!<br/>
<span class="indented">All that is within me, praise his holy name!</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Praise the Lord, my soul,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t forget all his benefits,</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> who forgives all your sins,<br/>
<span class="indented">who heals all your diseases,</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> who redeems your life from destruction,<br/>
<span class="indented">who crowns you with loving kindness and tender mercies,</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> who satisfies your desire with good things,<br/>
<span class="indented">so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> The Lord executes righteous acts,<br/>
<span class="indented">and justice for all who are oppressed.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> He made known his ways to Moses,<br/>
<span class="indented">his deeds to the children of Israel.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> The Lord is merciful and gracious,<br/>
<span class="indented">slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> He will not always accuse;<br/>
<span class="indented">neither will he stay angry forever.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> He has not dealt with us according to our sins,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor repaid us for our iniquities.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> For as the heavens are high above the earth,<br/>
<span class="indented">so great is his loving kindness toward those who fear him.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> As far as the east is from the west,<br/>
<span class="indented">so far has he removed our transgressions from us.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Like a father has compassion on his children,<br/>
<span class="indented">so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> For he knows how we are made.<br/>
<span class="indented">He remembers that we are dust.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> As for man, his days are like grass.<br/>
<span class="indented">As a flower of the field, so he flourishes.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> For the wind passes over it, and it is gone.<br/>
<span class="indented">Its place remembers it no more.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> But the Lord’s loving kindness is from everlasting to everlasting<br/>
<span class="indented">with those who fear him,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">his righteousness to children’s children;</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> to those who keep his covenant,<br/>
<span class="indented">to those who remember to obey his precepts.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> The Lord has established his throne in the heavens.<br/>
<span class="indented">His kingdom rules over all.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> Praise the Lord, you angels of his,<br/>
<span class="indented">who are mighty in strength, who fulfill his word,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">obeying the voice of his word.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> Praise the Lord, all you armies of his,<br/>
<span class="indented">you servants of his, who do his pleasure.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> Praise the Lord, all you works of his,<br/>
<span class="indented">in all places of his dominion.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Praise the Lord, my soul!</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 21:16–31 -->

<h4>Proverbs 21:16–31</h4>
<p>
<sup>16</sup> The man who wanders out of the way of understanding<br/>
<span class="indented">shall rest in the assembly of the departed spirits.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> He who loves pleasure will be a poor man.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who loves wine and oil won’t be rich.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> The wicked is a ransom for the righteous,<br/>
<span class="indented">the treacherous for the upright.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> It is better to dwell in a desert land,<br/>
<span class="indented">than with a contentious and fretful woman.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise,<br/>
<span class="indented">but a foolish man swallows it up.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> He who follows after righteousness and kindness<br/>
<span class="indented">finds life, righteousness, and honor.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> A wise man scales the city of the mighty,<br/>
<span class="indented">and brings down the strength of its confidence.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Whoever guards his mouth and his tongue<br/>
<span class="indented">keeps his soul from troubles.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> The proud and haughty man—“scoffer” is his name—<br/>
<span class="indented">he works in the arrogance of pride.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> The desire of the sluggard kills him,<br/>
<span class="indented">for his hands refuse to labor.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> There are those who covet greedily all day long;<br/>
<span class="indented">but the righteous give and don’t withhold.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination—<br/>
<span class="indented">how much more, when he brings it with a wicked mind!</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> A false witness will perish,<br/>
<span class="indented">and a man who listens speaks to eternity.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> A wicked man hardens his face;<br/>
<span class="indented">but as for the upright, he establishes his ways.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> There is no wisdom nor understanding<br/>
<span class="indented">nor counsel against the Lord.</span><br/>

<span class="indented">but there is a friend who is only a friend in name.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Isn’t there a grief in it—even to death—<br/>
<span class="indented">when a companion and friend is turned into an enemy?</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> O wicked imagination, why were you created<br/>
<span class="indented">to cover the land with deceit?</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> A companion delights in the gladness of a friend,<br/>
<span class="indented">but in time of affliction he will be against him.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> A companion labors with his friend to satisfy his appetite;<br/>
<span class="indented">but in time of trouble he will lift up his shield.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Don’t forget a friend in your soul;<br/>
<span class="indented">don’t be unmindful of him in your riches.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Every counselor extols counsel;<br/>
<span class="indented">but some give counsel for themselves.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Beware of a counselor; know before what is his interest<br/>
<span class="indented">(for he will take counsel for himself)</span><br/>
<span class="indented">lest he cast the lot against you</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> and say to you, “Your way is good,”<br/>
<span class="indented">then stand on the other side to see what will happen to you.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Don’t take counsel with one who looks askance at you,<br/>
<span class="indented">and hide your intentions from those who are jealous of you.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Don’t take counsel with a woman about her rival,<br/>
<span class="indented">with a coward about war,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">with a merchant about exchange,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">with a buyer about selling,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">with an envious man about thankfulness,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">with an unmerciful man about kindness,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">with a sluggard about any kind of work,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">with one who does yearly service about the end of a year,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">with a lazy servant about a big work—</span><br/>
<span class="indented">don’t depend on these for any counsel.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> But stay continually with a godly man,<br/>
<span class="indented">whom you know to be a keeper of the commandments,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">who is like-minded with yourself,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and who will sorrow with you if you fail.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> And establish the counsel of your own heart;<br/>
<span class="indented">for there is no one more faithful to you than it.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> For a man’s soul is sometimes inclined to inform him<br/>
<span class="indented">better than seven watchmen who sit on high on their watchtower.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Above all this, pray to the Most High<br/>
<span class="indented">that he may direct your way in truth.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Let reason be the beginning of every work,<br/>
<span class="indented">and let counsel go before every action.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> As a token of the changing of the heart,<br/>
<span class="indented">four sorts of things appear: good and evil, life and death;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and the tongue rules over them continually.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> A man of understanding instructs many,<br/>
<span class="indented">and he himself is useful to his own soul.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> He who speaks charmingly is hated.<br/>
<span class="indented">In every city, he will be despised for not speaking wisely.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> Yet a man is not favored for his fine speech,<br/>
<span class="indented">and no sinner is established for his outstanding gifts.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> He who does violence to his own house will inherit the wind.<br/>
<span class="indented">A fool will be servant to the wise-hearted.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> The mouth of the righteous produces wisdom,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the perverse tongue will be cut off.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable.<br/>
<span class="indented">The mouth of the wicked speaks perversity.</span><br/>
    *(Note: Some verses here overlap with Proverbs themes, but align with Sirach’s text context.)*<br/>
<sup>24</sup> Sort out your own advice first; after that, speak.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let your reasoning stand the test of truth.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> God’s blessing is not found where wickedness abides,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor does truth dwell in deceitful counsel.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> Let God’s wisdom guide your words and footsteps,<br/>
<span class="indented">that your ways may be established in righteousness.</span> </p></section>

<h4>Psalm 104</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Bless the Lord, my soul.<br/>
<span class="indented">Lord my God, you are very great.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">You are clothed with honor and majesty.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> He covers himself with light as with a garment.<br/>
<span class="indented">He stretches out the heavens like a curtain.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> He lays the beams of his rooms in the waters.<br/>
<span class="indented">He makes the clouds his chariot.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He walks on the wings of the wind.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> He makes his messengers winds;<br/>
<span class="indented">his servants flames of fire.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> He laid the foundations of the earth,<br/>
<span class="indented">that it should not be moved forever.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> You covered it with the deep as with a cloak.<br/>
<span class="indented">The waters stood above the mountains.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> At your rebuke they fled.<br/>
<span class="indented">At the voice of your thunder they hurried away.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> The mountains rose,<br/>
<span class="indented">the valleys sank down,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">to the place which you had assigned to them.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> You have set a boundary that they may not pass over,<br/>
<span class="indented">that they don’t turn again to cover the earth.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> He sends out springs into the valleys.<br/>
<span class="indented">They run among the mountains.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> They give drink to every animal of the field.<br/>
<span class="indented">The wild donkeys quench their thirst.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> The birds of the sky nest by them.<br/>
<span class="indented">They sing among the branches.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> He waters the mountains from his rooms.<br/>
<span class="indented">The earth is filled with the fruit of your works.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> He causes the grass to grow for the livestock,<br/>
<span class="indented">and plants for man to cultivate,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">that he may produce food out of the earth:</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> wine that makes glad the heart of man,<br/>
<span class="indented">oil to make his face to shine,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and bread that strengthens man’s heart.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> The Lord’s trees are well watered,<br/>
<span class="indented">the cedars of Lebanon, which he has planted;</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> where the birds make their nests.<br/>
<span class="indented">The stork makes its home in the cypress trees.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> The high mountains are for the wild goats.<br/>
<span class="indented">The rocks are a refuge for the rock badgers.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> He appointed the moon for seasons.<br/>
<span class="indented">The sun knows when to set.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> You make darkness, and it is night,<br/>
<span class="indented">in which all the animals of the forest prowl.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> The young lions roar after their prey,<br/>
<span class="indented">and seek their food from God.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> The sun rises, and they steal away,<br/>
<span class="indented">and lie down in their dens.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Man goes out to his work,<br/>
<span class="indented">to his labor until the evening.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> Lord, how many are your works!<br/>
<span class="indented">In wisdom you have made them all.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">The earth is full of your riches.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> There is the sea, great and wide,<br/>
<span class="indented">in which are innumerable living things,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">both small and large animals.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> There the ships go,<br/>
<span class="indented">and leviathan, whom you formed to play there.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> These all wait for you,<br/>
<span class="indented">that you may give them their food in due season.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> You give to them; they gather.<br/>
<span class="indented">You open your hand; they are satisfied with good.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> You hide your face; they are troubled.<br/>
<span class="indented">You take away their breath; they die, and return to the dust.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> You send out your Spirit and they are created.<br/>
<span class="indented">You renew the face of the ground.</span><br/>
<sup>31</sup> Let the Lord’s glory endure forever.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let the Lord rejoice in his works.</span><br/>
<sup>32</sup> He looks at the earth, and it trembles.<br/>
<span class="indented">He touches the mountains, and they smoke.</span><br/>
<sup>33</sup> I will sing to the Lord as long as I live.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.</span><br/>
<sup>34</sup> Let my meditation be sweet to him.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will rejoice in the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>35</sup> Let sinners be consumed out of the earth.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let the wicked be no more.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Bless the Lord, my soul.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Praise the Lord!</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 22:1–16 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 22:1–16</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> A good name is more desirable than great riches,<br/>
<span class="indented">and loving favor is better than silver and gold.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> The rich and the poor have this in common:<br/>
<span class="indented">the Lord is the maker of them all.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> A prudent man sees danger and hides himself;<br/>
<span class="indented">but the simple pass on, and suffer for it.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> The result of humility and the fear of the Lord<br/>
<span class="indented">is wealth, honor, and life.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Thorns and snares are in the path of the wicked:<br/>
<span class="indented">whoever guards his soul stays from them.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Train up a child in the way he should go,<br/>
<span class="indented">and when he is old he will not depart from it.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> The rich rule over the poor.<br/>
<span class="indented">The borrower is servant to the lender.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> He who sows wickedness reaps trouble,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the rod of his fury will be destroyed.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> He who has a generous eye will be blessed,<br/>
<span class="indented">for he shares his food with the poor.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Drive out the mocker, and strife will go out;<br/>
<span class="indented">yes, quarrels and insults will stop.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> He who loves purity of heart and speaks gracefully<br/>
<span class="indented">is the king’s friend.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> The Lord’s eyes watch over knowledge;<br/>
<span class="indented">but he frustrates the words of the unfaithful.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> The sluggard says, “There is a lion outside!<br/>
<span class="indented">I will be killed in the streets!”</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who is under the Lord’s wrath will fall into it.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Folly is bound up in the heart of a child.<br/>
<span class="indented">The rod of discipline drives it far from him.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Whoever oppresses the poor for his own increase and whoever gives to the rich,<br/>
<span class="indented">both come to poverty.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 38 -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 38:1–15</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Honor a physician with the honor due to him<br/>
<span class="indented">for the uses which you may have of him;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for truly the Lord has created him.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> For from the Most High comes healing,<br/>
<span class="indented">and he will receive a gift from the king.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> The skill of the physician lifts up his head.<br/>
<span class="indented">In the sight of great men, he will be admired.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> The Lord created medicines out of the earth.<br/>
<span class="indented">A prudent man will not abhor them.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Wasn’t water made sweet with wood,<br/>
<span class="indented">that its virtue might be known?</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> And he has given men skill,<br/>
<span class="indented">that he might be glorified in his marvelous works.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> With them, the pharmacist makes a mixture.<br/>
<span class="indented">He will not cease from their works.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Peace from him is over all the earth.<br/>
<span class="indented">My son, don’t be negligent when you are sick,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">but pray to the Lord, and he will heal you.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Put away wrongdoing. Cleanse your hands.<br/>
<span class="indented">Cleanse your heart from all sin.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Offer a sweet offering and a memorial of fine flour.<br/>
<span class="indented">Make your offering as rich as you can afford.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Then give place to the physician, for truly the Lord has created him.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t let him go away from you, for you need him.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> There is a time when in their hands is the success of their craft;<br/>
<sup>13</sup> for they will also beg the Lord to prosper their diagnosis for the sake of preserving life.<br/>
<sup>14</sup> He who sins before his Maker—<br/>
<span class="indented">let him fall into the hand of the physician.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> My son, let your tears fall over the dead,<br/>
<span class="indented">and begin to lament as if you had suffered great harm yourself;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and then cover his body according to his due,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t neglect his burial.</span></p><br/>

<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 105</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Give thanks to the Lord! Call on his name!<br/>
<span class="indented">Make his doings known among the peoples.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Sing to him, sing praises to him!<br/>
<span class="indented">Tell of all his marvelous works.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Glory in his holy name.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let the heart of those who seek the Lord rejoice.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Seek the Lord and his strength.<br/>
<span class="indented">Seek his face forever more.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Remember his marvelous works that he has done;<br/>
<span class="indented">his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> you offspring of Abraham, his servant,<br/>
<span class="indented">you children of Jacob, his chosen ones.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> He is the Lord, our God.<br/>
<span class="indented">His judgments are in all the earth.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> He has remembered his covenant forever,<br/>
<span class="indented">the word which he commanded to a thousand generations,</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> the covenant which he made with Abraham,<br/>
<span class="indented">his oath to Isaac,</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> and confirmed it to Jacob for a statute;<br/>
<span class="indented">to Israel for an everlasting covenant,</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan,<br/>
<span class="indented">the lot of your inheritance,”</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> when they were but a few men in number,<br/>
<span class="indented">yes, very few, and foreigners in it.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> They went about from nation to nation,<br/>
<span class="indented">from one kingdom to another people.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> He allowed no one to do them wrong.<br/>
<span class="indented">Yes, he reproved kings for their sakes,</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> “Don’t touch my anointed ones!<br/>
<span class="indented">Do my prophets no harm!”</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> He called for a famine on the land.<br/>
<span class="indented">He destroyed the food supplies.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> He sent a man before them.<br/>
<span class="indented">Joseph was sold for a slave.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> They bruised his feet with shackles.<br/>
<span class="indented">His neck was locked in irons,</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> until the time that his word happened,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the Lord’s word proved him true.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> The king sent and freed him;<br/>
<span class="indented">even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> He made him lord of his house,<br/>
<span class="indented">and ruler of all of his possessions;</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> to discipline his princes at his pleasure,<br/>
<span class="indented">and to teach his elders wisdom.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Israel also came into Egypt.<br/>
<span class="indented">Jacob lived in the land of Ham.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> He increased his people greatly,<br/>
<span class="indented">and made them stronger than their adversaries.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> He turned their heart to hate his people,<br/>
<span class="indented">to conspire against his servants.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> He sent Moses, his servant,<br/>
<span class="indented">and Aaron, whom he had chosen.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> They performed miracles among them,<br/>
<span class="indented">and wonders in the land of Ham.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> He sent darkness, and made it dark.<br/>
<span class="indented">They didn’t rebel against his words.</span><br/>

<span class="indented">and killed their fish.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> Their land swarmed with frogs,<br/>
<span class="indented">even in the rooms of their kings.</span><br/>
<sup>31</sup> He spoke, and swarms of flies came,<br/>
<span class="indented">and lice in all their borders.</span><br/>
<sup>32</sup> He gave them hail for rain,<br/>
<span class="indented">with lightning in their land.</span><br/>
<sup>33</sup> He struck their vines and also their fig trees,<br/>
<span class="indented">and shattered the trees of their country.</span><br/>
<sup>34</sup> He spoke, and the locusts came<br/>
<span class="indented">with the grasshoppers, without number.</span><br/>
<sup>35</sup> They ate up every plant in their land;<br/>
<span class="indented">and ate up the fruit of their ground.</span><br/>
<sup>36</sup> He struck also all the firstborn in their land,<br/>
<span class="indented">the first fruits of all their manhood.</span><br/>
<sup>37</sup> He brought them out with silver and gold.<br/>
<span class="indented">There was not one feeble person among his tribes.</span><br/>

<span class="indented">for the fear of them had fallen on them.</span><br/>
<sup>39</sup> He spread a cloud for a covering,<br/>
<span class="indented">fire to give light in the night.</span><br/>
<sup>40</sup> They asked, and he brought quails,<br/>
<span class="indented">and satisfied them with the bread of the sky.</span><br/>
<sup>41</sup> He opened the rock, and waters gushed out.<br/>
<span class="indented">They ran as a river in the dry places.</span><br/>
<sup>42</sup> For he remembered his holy word,<br/>
<span class="indented">and Abraham, his servant.</span><br/>
<sup>43</sup> He brought his people out with joy,<br/>
<span class="indented">his chosen with singing.</span><br/>
<sup>44</sup> He gave them the lands of the nations.<br/>
<span class="indented">They took the labor of peoples in possession,</span><br/>

<h4>Proverbs 22:17–29</h4>
<p>
<sup>17</sup> Turn your ear, and listen to the words of the wise.<br/>
<span class="indented">Apply your heart to my teaching.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> For it is a pleasant thing if you keep them within you,<br/>
<span class="indented">if all of them are ready on your lips.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> That your trust may be in the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">I teach you today, even you.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> Haven’t I written to you thirty excellent things<br/>
<span class="indented">of counsel and knowledge,</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> to teach you truth, reliable words,<br/>
<span class="indented">to give sound answers to the ones who sent you?</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> Don’t exploit the poor because he is poor;<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t crush the needy in court;</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> for the Lord will plead their case,<br/>
<span class="indented">and plunder the life of those who plunder them.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> Don’t befriend a hot-tempered man,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t associate with one who harbors anger;</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> lest you learn his ways,<br/>
<span class="indented">and ensnare your soul.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> Don’t you be one of those who strike hands,<br/>
<span class="indented">of those who are collateral for debts.</span><br/>

<span class="indented">why should he take away your bed from under you?</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> Don’t move the ancient boundary stone,<br/>
<span class="indented">which your fathers have set up.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> Do you see a man skilled in his work?<br/>
<span class="indented">He will serve kings.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He won’t serve obscure men.</span> </p> <!-- No Sirach reading for Day 42 -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 38:16–34</h4>
<p>
<sup>16</sup> Weep bitterly, and make great lamentation,<br/>
<span class="indented">and make mourning according to his merit,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for a day or two, lest you be spoken evil of;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and so comfort yourself for your sorrow.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> For of heaviness comes death,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the heaviness of the heart breaks strength.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> When you’re taken away, sorrow remains.<br/>
<span class="indented">A poor man’s life is better than a fool’s death.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> In the clothing of the heart is sorrow;<br/>
<span class="indented">and the wickedness of a man weighs down his heart.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> Don’t give your heart to sorrow.<br/>
<span class="indented">Put it away, remembering your end.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> Don’t forget it, for there is no coming again;<br/>
<span class="indented">you do him no good, and you hurt yourself.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> Remember his judgment, for yours also will be so.<br/>
<span class="indented">Yesterday was his, and today yours.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> When the dead is at rest, let his remembrance rest;<br/>
<span class="indented">be comforted for him, once his spirit has departed.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> The wisdom of a scribe comes by opportunity of leisure.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who has little business shall become wise.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> How can he get wisdom who holds the plow,<br/>
<span class="indented">who glories in the shaft of the goad,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">who drives oxen, and is occupied in their labors,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and whose talk is about bulls?</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> He sets his heart upon turning his furrows.<br/>
<span class="indented">His lack of sleep is to give his heifers fodder.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> So is every craftsman and workmaster,<br/>
<span class="indented">who labors night and day:</span><br/>
<span class="indented">those who engrave signets, and are diligent to make great variety.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">They set their heart upon the likeness of the image,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and watch over the work to finish it perfectly.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> So does the smith sitting by the anvil,<br/>
<span class="indented">considering the unwrought iron.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">The vapor of the fire wastes his flesh.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He wrestles in the heat of the furnace.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">The noise of the hammer is ever in his ears,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and his eyes are upon the pattern of the vessel.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> So does the potter, sitting at his work,<br/>
<span class="indented">turning the wheel around with his feet,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">who is always anxiously set at his work,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and makes all his output by number.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> He fashions the clay with his arm.<br/>
<span class="indented">He bends down his strength before his feet.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He applies his heart to finish the glazing,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and is careful to clean the furnace.</span><br/>
<sup>31</sup> All these trust in their hands;<br/>
<span class="indented">each is wise in his own craft.</span><br/>
<sup>32</sup> Without these, a city can’t be inhabited.<br/>
<span class="indented">They will neither live nor walk around there.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Yet they are not sought out in the council of the people,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">nor do they mount on high in the assembly;</span><br/>
<sup>33</sup> They don’t sit on the seat of the judge,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor understand the covenant of judgment.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">They can’t declare instruction and judgment,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and they are not found using proverbs.</span><br/>
<sup>34</sup> But they maintain the fabric of the world.<br/>
<span class="indented">Their desire is in the work of their craft.</span> </p></section>

<sup>2</sup> Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">or fully declare all his praise?</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Blessed are those who keep justice.<br/>
<span class="indented">Blessed is one who does what is right at all times.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Remember me, Lord, with the favor that you show to your people.<br/>
<span class="indented">Visit me with your salvation,</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> that I may see the prosperity of your chosen,<br/>
<span class="indented">that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">that I may glory with your inheritance.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> We have sinned with our fathers.<br/>
<span class="indented">We have committed iniquity.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">We have done wickedly.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Our fathers didn’t understand your wonders in Egypt.<br/>
<span class="indented">They didn’t remember the multitude of your loving kindnesses,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake,<br/>
<span class="indented">that he might make his mighty power known.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up;<br/>
<span class="indented">so he led them through the depths, as through a desert.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> He saved them from the hand of him who hated them,<br/>
<span class="indented">and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> The waters covered their adversaries.<br/>
<span class="indented">There was not one of them left.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Then they believed his words.<br/>
<span class="indented">They sang his praise.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> They soon forgot his works.<br/>
<span class="indented">They didn’t wait for his counsel,</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> but gave in to craving in the desert,<br/>
<span class="indented">and tested God in the wasteland.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> He gave them their request,<br/>
<span class="indented">but sent leanness into their soul.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> They envied Moses also in the camp,<br/>
<span class="indented">and Aaron, the Lord’s saint.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,<br/>
<span class="indented">and covered the company of Abiram.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> A fire was kindled in their company.<br/>
<span class="indented">The flame burned up the wicked.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> They made a calf in Horeb,<br/>
<span class="indented">and worshiped a molten image.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> Thus they exchanged their glory<br/>
<span class="indented">for an image of a bull that eats grass.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> They forgot God, their Savior,<br/>
<span class="indented">who had done great things in Egypt,</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> wondrous works in the land of Ham,<br/>
<span class="indented">and awesome things by the Red Sea.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Therefore he said that he would destroy them,<br/>
<span class="indented">had Moses, his chosen, not stood before him in the breach,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">to turn away his wrath, so that he wouldn’t destroy them.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> Yes, they despised the pleasant land.<br/>
<span class="indented">They didn’t believe his word,</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> but murmured in their tents,<br/>
<span class="indented">and didn’t listen to the Lord’s voice.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> Therefore he swore to them<br/>
<span class="indented">that he would overthrow them in the wilderness,</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> that he would overthrow their offspring among the nations,<br/>
<span class="indented">and scatter them in the lands.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> They joined themselves also to Baal Peor,<br/>
<span class="indented">and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> Thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds.<br/>
<span class="indented">The plague broke in on them.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> Then Phinehas stood up and executed judgment,<br/>
<span class="indented">so the plague was stopped.</span><br/>
<sup>31</sup> That was credited to him for righteousness<br/>
<span class="indented">for all generations to come.</span><br/>
<sup>32</sup> They angered him also at the waters of Meribah,<br/>
<span class="indented">so that Moses was troubled for their sakes;</span><br/>
<sup>33</sup> because they were rebellious against his spirit,<br/>
<span class="indented">he spoke rashly with his lips.</span><br/>
<sup>34</sup> They didn’t destroy the peoples,<br/>
<span class="indented">as the Lord commanded them,</span><br/>
<sup>35</sup> but mixed themselves with the nations,<br/>
<span class="indented">and learned their works.</span><br/>
<sup>36</sup> They served their idols,<br/>
<span class="indented">which became a snare to them.</span><br/>
<sup>37</sup> Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.<br/>
<sup>38</sup> They shed innocent blood,<br/>
<span class="indented">even the blood of their sons and of their daughters,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">The land was polluted with blood.</span><br/>
<sup>39</sup> Thus they were defiled with their works,<br/>
<span class="indented">and prostituted themselves in their deeds.</span><br/>
<sup>40</sup> Therefore the Lord burned with anger against his people.<br/>
<span class="indented">He abhorred his inheritance.</span><br/>
<sup>41</sup> He gave them into the hand of the nations.<br/>
<span class="indented">Those who hated them ruled over them.</span><br/>
<sup>42</sup> Their enemies also oppressed them.<br/>
<span class="indented">They were brought into subjection under their hand.</span><br/>
<sup>43</sup> He rescued them many times,<br/>
<span class="indented">but they were rebellious in their counsel,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and were brought low in their iniquity.</span><br/>
<sup>44</sup> Nevertheless he regarded their distress,<br/>
<span class="indented">when he heard their cry.</span><br/>
<sup>45</sup> He remembered for them his covenant,<br/>
<span class="indented">and repented according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.</span><br/>
<sup>46</sup> He made them also to be pitied<br/>
<span class="indented">by all those who carried them captive.</span><br/>
<sup>47</sup> Save us, Lord, our God,<br/>
<span class="indented">gather us from among the nations,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">to give thanks to your holy name,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">to triumph in your praise!</span><br/>
<sup>48</sup> Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,<br/>
<span class="indented">from everlasting even to everlasting!</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Let all the people say, “Amen.”</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Praise the Lord!</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 23:1–18 -->

<h4>Proverbs 23:1–18</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> When you sit to eat with a ruler,<br/>
<span class="indented">consider diligently what is before you;</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> put a knife to your throat<br/>
<span class="indented">if you are a man given to appetite.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Don’t be desirous of his dainties,<br/>
<span class="indented">since they are deceitful food.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Don’t weary yourself to be rich.<br/>
<span class="indented">In your wisdom, show restraint.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Why do you set your eyes on that which is not?<br/>
<span class="indented">For it certainly sprouts wings like an eagle and flies in the sky.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Don’t eat the food of him who has a stingy eye,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t crave his delicacies;</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> for as he thinks about the cost, so he is.<br/>
<span class="indented">“Eat and drink!” he says to you,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">but his heart is not with you.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> You will vomit up the morsel which you have eaten<br/>
<span class="indented">and waste your pleasant words.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Don’t speak in the ears of a fool,<br/>
<span class="indented">for he will despise the wisdom of your words.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Don’t move the ancient boundary stone.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t encroach on the fields of the fatherless;</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> for their Defender is strong.<br/>
<span class="indented">He will plead their case against you.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Apply your heart to instruction,<br/>
<span class="indented">and your ears to the words of knowledge.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Don’t withhold correction from a child.<br/>
<span class="indented">If you punish him with the rod, he will not die.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Punish him with the rod,<br/>
<span class="indented">and save his soul from Sheol.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> My son, if your heart is wise,<br/>
<span class="indented">then my heart will be glad, even mine.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Yes, my heart will rejoice,<br/>
<span class="indented">when your lips speak what is right.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Don’t let your heart envy sinners,<br/>
<span class="indented">but rather fear the Lord all day long.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> Indeed surely there is a future hope,<br/>
<span class="indented">and your hope will not be cut off.</span> </p> <!-- No Sirach reading for Day 43 -->

<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 107</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Give thanks to the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">for he is good,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for his loving kindness endures forever.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Let the redeemed by the Lord say so,<br/>
<span class="indented">whom he has redeemed from the hand of the adversary,</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> and gathered out of the lands,<br/>
<span class="indented">from the east and from the west,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">from the north and from the south.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way.<br/>
<span class="indented">They found no city to live in.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Hungry and thirsty,<br/>
<span class="indented">their soul fainted in them.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble,<br/>
<span class="indented">and he delivered them out of their distresses.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> He led them also by a straight way,<br/>
<span class="indented">that they might go to a city to live in.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Let them praise the Lord for his loving kindness,<br/>
<span class="indented">for his wonderful deeds for the children of men!</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> For he satisfies the longing soul.<br/>
<span class="indented">He fills the hungry soul with good.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death,<br/>
<span class="indented">being bound in affliction and iron,</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> because they rebelled against the words of God,<br/>
<span class="indented">and scorned the counsel of the Most High.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Therefore he brought down their heart with labor.<br/>
<span class="indented">They fell down, and there was no one to help.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble,<br/>
<span class="indented">and he saved them out of their distresses.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,<br/>
<span class="indented">and broke away their chains.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Let them praise the Lord for his loving kindness,<br/>
<span class="indented">for his wonderful deeds to the children of men!</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> For he has broken the gates of bronze,<br/>
<span class="indented">and cut through bars of iron.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Fools are afflicted because of their disobedience,<br/>
<span class="indented">and because of their iniquities.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> Their soul abhors all kinds of food.<br/>
<span class="indented">They draw near to the gates of death.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> Then they cry to the Lord in their trouble,<br/>
<span class="indented">he saves them out of their distresses.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> He sends his word, and heals them,<br/>
<span class="indented">and delivers them from their graves.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> Let them praise the Lord for his loving kindness,<br/>
<span class="indented">for his wonderful deeds for the children of men!</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> Let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving,<br/>
<span class="indented">and declare his deeds with singing.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Those who go down to the sea in ships,<br/>
<span class="indented">who do business in great waters;</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> these see the Lord’s deeds,<br/>
<span class="indented">and his wonders in the deep.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> For he commands, and raises the stormy wind,<br/>
<span class="indented">which lifts up its waves.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> They mount up to the sky; they go down again to the depths.<br/>
<span class="indented">Their soul melts away because of trouble.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> They reel back and forth, and stagger like a drunken man,<br/>
<span class="indented">and are at their wits’ end.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> Then they cry to the Lord in their trouble,<br/>
<span class="indented">and he brings them out of their distress.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> He makes the storm a calm,<br/>
<span class="indented">so that its waves are still.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> Then they are glad because it is calm,<br/>
<span class="indented">so he brings them to their desired haven.</span><br/>
<sup>31</sup> Let them praise the Lord for his loving kindness,<br/>
<span class="indented">for his wonderful deeds for the children of men!</span><br/>
<sup>32</sup> Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people,<br/>
<span class="indented">and praise him in the seat of the elders.</span><br/>
<sup>33</sup> He turns rivers into a desert,<br/>
<span class="indented">water springs into a thirsty ground,</span><br/>
<sup>34</sup> and a fruitful land into a salt waste,<br/>
<span class="indented">for the wickedness of those who dwell in it.</span><br/>
<sup>35</sup> He turns a desert into a pool of water,<br/>
<span class="indented">and a dry land into water springs.</span><br/>
<sup>36</sup> There he makes the hungry live,<br/>
<span class="indented">that they may prepare a city to live in,</span><br/>
<sup>37</sup> sow fields, plant vineyards,<br/>
<span class="indented">and reap the fruits of increase.</span><br/>
<sup>38</sup> He blesses them also, so that they are multiplied greatly.<br/>
<span class="indented">He doesn’t allow their livestock to decrease.</span><br/>
<sup>39</sup> Again, they are diminished and bowed down<br/>
<span class="indented">through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.</span><br/>
<sup>40</sup> He pours contempt on princes,<br/>
<span class="indented">and causes them to wander in a trackless waste.</span><br/>
<sup>41</sup> Yet he lifts the needy out of their affliction,<br/>
<span class="indented">and increases their families like a flock.</span><br/>
<sup>42</sup> The upright will see it, and be glad.<br/>
<span class="indented">All the wicked will shut their mouths.</span><br/>
<sup>43</sup> Whoever is wise will pay attention to these things.<br/>
<span class="indented">They will consider the loving kindnesses of the Lord.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 23:19–35 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 23:19–35</h4>
<p>
<sup>19</sup> Listen, my son, and be wise,<br/>
<span class="indented">and keep your heart on the right path!</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> Don’t be among ones drinking too much wine,<br/>
<span class="indented">or those who gorge themselves on meat;</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> for the drunkard and the glutton shall become poor,<br/>
<span class="indented">and drowsiness clothes them in rags.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> Listen to your father who gave you life,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t despise your mother when she is old.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Buy the truth, and don’t sell it.<br/>
<span class="indented">Get wisdom, discipline, and understanding.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> The father of the righteous has great joy.<br/>
<span class="indented">Whoever fathers a wise child delights in him.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> Let your father and your mother be glad!<br/>
<span class="indented">Let her who bore you rejoice!</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> My son, give me your heart,<br/>
<span class="indented">and let your eyes keep in my ways.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> For a prostitute is a deep pit;<br/>
<span class="indented">and a wayward wife is a narrow well.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> Yes, she lies in wait like a robber,<br/>
<span class="indented">and increases the unfaithful among men.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> Who has woe?<br/>
<span class="indented">Who has sorrow?</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Who has strife?</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Who has complaints?</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Who has needless bruises?</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Who has bloodshot eyes?</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> Those who stay long at the wine;<br/>
<span class="indented">those who go to seek out mixed wine.</span><br/>
<sup>31</sup> Don’t look at the wine when it is red,<br/>
<span class="indented">when it sparkles in the cup,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">when it goes down smoothly.</span><br/>
<sup>32</sup> In the end, it bites like a snake,<br/>
<span class="indented">and poisons like a viper.</span><br/>
<sup>33</sup> Your eyes will see strange things,<br/>
<span class="indented">and your mind will imagine confusing things.</span><br/>
<sup>34</sup> Yes, you will be as he who lies down in the midst of the sea,<br/>
<span class="indented">or as he who lies on top of the rigging:</span><br/>
<sup>35</sup> “They hit me, and I was not hurt!<br/>
<span class="indented">They beat me, and I don’t feel it!</span><br/>
<span class="indented">When will I wake up?</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I will do it again.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I will look for more.”</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 39:1–18 -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 39:1–18</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> He who devotes himself to the study of the law of the Most High<br/>
<span class="indented">and ponders the wisdom of all the ancients</span><br/>
<span class="indented">will keep his heart to perceive the subtle points;</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> he will be active among renowned men,<br/>
<span class="indented">and appear before rulers.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He will travel through the lands of foreign nations;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for he has tested good things among men.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> He will direct his heart early to resort to the Lord who made him,<br/>
<span class="indented">and will make supplication before the Most High.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He will open his mouth in prayer,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and make supplication for his sins.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> If the great Lord will,<br/>
<span class="indented">he will be filled with the spirit of understanding.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He will pour forth wise sayings,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and give thanks to the Lord in prayer.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> He will direct his counsel and knowledge,<br/>
<span class="indented">and meditate on his secrets.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> He will show the instruction which he has been taught,<br/>
<span class="indented">and will glory in the law of the Lord’s covenant.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Many will commend his understanding.<br/>
<span class="indented">It will never be blotted out.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">His memory will not depart;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">his name will live through all generations.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Nations will declare his wisdom,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the congregation will proclaim his praise.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> If he continues, he will leave a name greater than a thousand,<br/>
<span class="indented">and if he goes to rest, it will be to his advantage.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Yet more, I will utter, saying as I have thought;<br/>
<span class="indented">I am filled as the moon at the full.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Listen to me, you holy children,<br/>
<span class="indented">and bud like a rose growing by a brook of water.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Give off a sweet fragrance like frankincense.<br/>
<span class="indented">Blossom as a lily.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Send forth a fragrance, and sing a hymn of praise.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Bless the Lord for all his works.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Magnify his name.<br/>
<span class="indented">Proclaim his praise</span><br/>
<span class="indented">with the songs of your lips, and with harps.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Thus you shall say when you proclaim his praise:</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> “All the works of the Lord are exceedingly good,<br/>
<span class="indented">and every command will be accomplished in its season.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> No one can say, ‘What is this?’ or ‘Why is that?’<br/>
<span class="indented">For every question will be answered in its time.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">His command will satisfy every need,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and none can hinder his salvation.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> The works of all flesh are before him;<br/>
<span class="indented">nothing can be hidden from his eyes.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> He sees from everlasting to everlasting;<br/>
<span class="indented">there is nothing too marvelous for him.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> No one can say, ‘What is this?’ or ‘Why is that?’<br/>
<span class="indented">for everything is created for its own use.”</span> </p></section>

<sup>1</sup> My heart is steadfast, God.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will sing and I will make music with my soul.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Wake up, harp and lyre!<br/>
<span class="indented">I will wake up the dawn.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> I will give thanks to you, Lord, among the nations.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will sing praises to you among the peoples.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> For your loving kindness is great above the heavens.<br/>
<span class="indented">Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Be exalted, God, above the heavens,<br/>
<span class="indented">and let your glory be over all the earth.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> That your beloved may be delivered,<br/>
<span class="indented">save with your right hand, and answer us.</span><br/>

<span class="indented">I will divide Shechem,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and measure out the valley of Succoth.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Gilead is mine. Manasseh is mine.<br/>

<span class="indented">Who has led me to Edom?</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Haven’t you rejected us, God?<br/>
<span class="indented">You don’t go out, God, with our armies.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Give us help against the enemy,<br/>

<p>
<sup>1</sup> God of my praise, don’t remain silent,<br/>
<sup>2</sup> for they have opened the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit against me.<br/>
<span class="indented">They have spoken to me with a lying tongue.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> They have also surrounded me with words of hatred,<br/>
<span class="indented">and have fought against me without a cause.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> In return for my love, they are my adversaries;<br/>
<span class="indented">but I am in prayer.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> They have rewarded me evil for good,<br/>
<span class="indented">and hatred for my love.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Set a wicked man over him.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let an adversary stand at his right hand.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> When he is judged, let him come out guilty.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let his prayer be turned into sin.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Let his days be few.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let another take his office.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Let his children be fatherless,<br/>
<span class="indented">and his wife a widow.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Let his children be wandering beggars.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let them be sought from their ruins.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Let the creditor seize all that he has.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let strangers plunder the fruit of his labor.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Let there be no one to extend kindness to him,<br/>
<span class="indented">neither let there be anyone to have pity on his fatherless children.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Let his posterity be cut off.<br/>
<span class="indented">In the generation following let their name be blotted out.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered by the Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t let the sin of his mother be blotted out.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Let them be before the Lord continually,<br/>
<span class="indented">that he may cut off their memory from the earth;</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> because he didn’t remember to show kindness,<br/>
<span class="indented">but persecuted the poor and needy man,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">the broken in heart, to kill them.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Yes, he loved cursing, and it came to him.<br/>
<span class="indented">He didn’t delight in blessing, and it was far from him.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment.<br/>
<span class="indented">It came into his inward parts like water,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">like oil into his bones.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> Let it be to him as the clothing with which he covers himself,<br/>
<span class="indented">for the belt that is always around him.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> This is the reward of my adversaries from the Lord,<br/>

<span class="indented">My heart is wounded within me.</span><br/>

<span class="indented">My body is thin and lacks fat.</span><br/>

<span class="indented">that you, Lord, have done it.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> They may curse, but you bless.<br/>
<span class="indented">When they arise, they will be shamed,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">but your servant shall rejoice.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> Let my adversaries be clothed with dishonor.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> I will give great thanks to the Lord with my mouth.<br/>
<span class="indented">Yes, I will praise him among the multitude.</span><br/>

<h4>Proverbs 24:1–16</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Don’t be envious of evil men,<br/>
<span class="indented">neither desire to be with them;</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> for their hearts plot violence,<br/>
<span class="indented">and their lips talk about mischief.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Through wisdom a house is built;<br/>
<span class="indented">by understanding it is established;</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> by knowledge the rooms are filled<br/>
<span class="indented">with all rare and beautiful treasure.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> A wise man has great power;<br/>
<span class="indented">and a knowledgeable man increases strength;</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> for by wise guidance you wage your war;<br/>
<span class="indented">and victory is in many advisors.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Wisdom is too high for a fool.<br/>
<span class="indented">He doesn’t open his mouth in the gate.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> One who plots to do evil<br/>
<span class="indented">will be called a schemer.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> The schemes of folly are sin.<br/>
<span class="indented">The mocker is detested by men.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> If you falter in the time of trouble,<br/>
<span class="indented">your strength is small.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Rescue those who are being led away to death!<br/>
<span class="indented">Indeed, hold back those who are staggering to the slaughter!</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> If you say, “Behold, we didn’t know this,”<br/>
<span class="indented">doesn’t he who weighs the hearts consider it?</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He who keeps your soul, doesn’t he know it?</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Shall he not render to every man according to his work?</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> My son, eat honey, for it is good,<br/>
<span class="indented">the droppings of the honeycomb, which are sweet to your taste;</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> so you shall know wisdom to be to your soul.<br/>
<span class="indented">If you have found it, then there will be a reward;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">your hope will not be cut off.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Don’t lay in wait, wicked man, against the habitation of the righteous.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t destroy his resting place;</span><br/>

<h4>Proverbs 24:17–34</h4>
<p>
<sup>17</sup> Don’t rejoice when your enemy falls.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t let your heart be glad when he is overthrown,</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> lest the Lord see it, and it displease him,<br/>
<span class="indented">and he turn away his wrath from him.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> Don’t fret yourself because of evildoers,<br/>
<span class="indented">neither be envious of the wicked;</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> for there will be no reward to the evil man.<br/>
<span class="indented">The lamp of the wicked will be snuffed out.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> My son, fear the Lord and the king.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t join those who are rebellious;</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> for their calamity will rise suddenly.<br/>
<span class="indented">Who knows what destruction may come from them both?</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> These also are sayings of the wise.<br/>
<span class="indented">To show partiality in judgment is not good.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> He who says to the wicked, “You are righteous,”<br/>
<span class="indented">peoples will curse him, and nations will abhor him;</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> but it will go well with those who convict the guilty,<br/>
<span class="indented">and a rich blessing will come on them.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> An honest answer<br/>
<span class="indented">is like a kiss on the lips.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> Prepare your work outside,<br/>
<span class="indented">and get your fields ready.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Afterwards, build your house.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> Don’t be a witness against your neighbor without cause.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t deceive with your lips.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> Don’t say, “I will do to him as he has done to me;<br/>
<span class="indented">I will repay the man according to his work.”</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> I went by the field of the sluggard,<br/>
<span class="indented">by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;</span><br/>
<sup>31</sup> behold, it was all grown over with thorns.<br/>
<span class="indented">Its surface was covered with nettles,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and its stone wall was broken down.</span><br/>
<sup>32</sup> Then I saw, and considered well.<br/>
<span class="indented">I saw, and received instruction:</span><br/>
<sup>33</sup> a little sleep, a little slumber,<br/>
<span class="indented">a little folding of the hands to sleep;</span><br/>
<sup>34</sup> so your poverty will come as a robber,<br/>
<span class="indented">and your want as an armed man.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 40 -->

<h4>Sirach 40</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Great travail is created for every man,<br/>
<span class="indented">and a heavy yoke is upon the sons of Adam,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">from the day of their coming out of their mother’s womb,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">until the day of their return to the mother of all things—</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> their imagination of things to come, and the day of death.<br/>
<sup>3</sup> From him who sits on a throne of glory to him who is humbled in earth and ashes;<br/>
<sup>4</sup> from him who wears purple and a crown, to him who is clothed with a rough linen frock—<br/>
<sup>5</sup> there is wrath, envy, trouble, unrest, and fear of death,<br/>
<span class="indented">and anger forever abides.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> In the time of rest upon his bed,<br/>
<span class="indented">the sleep of the night changes his knowledge.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> A little or nothing is his rest,<br/>
<span class="indented">and afterward in his sleep, as in a day of keeping watch,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">he is disturbed by the vision of his heart,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">as one who escaped from the front of battle.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> In the day of his safety, he wakes up, trembling,<br/>
<span class="indented">perceiving the vanity of his fear.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> With all flesh, man, beast, and sinner—<br/>
<span class="indented">sevenfold more for sinners.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Death, bloodshed, strife, sword,<br/>
<span class="indented">calamities, famine, tribulation, and the scourge—</span><br/>
<span class="indented">these things are created for the wicked,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and for their sakes destruction came.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> All that is of the earth returns to the earth.<br/>
<span class="indented">That which is of the waters returns to the sea.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> All bribery and injustice will be blotted out,<br/>
<span class="indented">but true dealing will stand forever.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> The goods of the unjust will be dried up like a river,<br/>
<span class="indented">and will vanish with noise like great thunder in rain.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> While he opens his hands, he will rejoice;<br/>
<span class="indented">so transgressors will come to nothing.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> The children of the ungodly will not put out many branches.<br/>
<span class="indented">They are as unclean roots upon a sheer rock.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> The reeds by every water or river bank are plucked up before all grass.<br/>
<sup>17</sup> Kindness is like a paradise of blessings.<br/>
<span class="indented">Charity endures forever.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> Life is sweet to a diligent laboring man,<br/>
<span class="indented">but he who finds treasure is better than both.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> Children and the building of a city establish a man’s name,<br/>
<span class="indented">but a blameless wife is counted better than both.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> Wine and music rejoice the heart,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the love of wisdom is better than both.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> The flute and the lute make sweet melody,<br/>
<span class="indented">but a pleasant tongue is better than both.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> Your eye desires grace and beauty,<br/>
<span class="indented">but green plants more than both.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> A friend and a companion meet occasionally,<br/>
<span class="indented">but it is better than both to have a wife and a husband,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">along with each other.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> Brothers and help are for a time of trouble;<br/>
<span class="indented">but almsgiving rescues better than both.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> Gold and silver will make the foot stand sure,<br/>
<span class="indented">but well-ordered counsel is esteemed more than both.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> Wealth and strength lift up the heart,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the fear of the Lord is better than both.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">There is no lack with the fear of the Lord,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and with it there is no need to seek for help.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> The fear of the Lord is like a paradise of blessing;<br/>
<span class="indented">it covers a man more than any glory.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> My son, don’t lead a beggar’s life.<br/>
<span class="indented">Better it is to die than to beg.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> A man who looks to the table of another person,<br/>
<span class="indented">his life is not considered as a life.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He will pollute his soul with another man’s food;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">but a wise man and well-instructed will beware of that.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> Begging is sweet in the mouth of the shameless,<br/>
<span class="indented">but in his belly a fire shall be kindled.</span> </p></section>

<sup>5</sup> What was it, you sea, that you fled?<br/>
<span class="indented">You Jordan, that you turned back?</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> You mountains, that you skipped like rams?<br/>
<span class="indented">You little hills, like lambs?</span><br/>

<sup>3</sup> The cords of death surrounded me,<br/>
<span class="indented">the pains of Sheol got a hold of me.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I found trouble and sorrow.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Then I called on the Lord’s name:<br/>

<span class="indented">Yes, our God is merciful.</span><br/>

<span class="indented">“I was greatly afflicted.”</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> I said in my haste,<br/>
<span class="indented">“All people are liars.”</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> What will I give to the Lord for all his benefits toward me?<br/>

<span class="indented">so the hearts of kings are unsearchable.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Take away the dross from the silver,<br/>
<span class="indented">and material comes out for the refiner;</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> take away the wicked from the king’s presence,<br/>
<span class="indented">and his throne will be established in righteousness.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Don’t exalt yourself in the presence of the king,<br/>
<span class="indented">or claim a place among great men;</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> for it is better that it be said to you, “Come up here,”<br/>
<span class="indented">than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">whom your eyes have seen.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Don’t be hasty in bringing charges to court.<br/>
<span class="indented">What will you do in the end when your neighbor shames you?</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Debate your case with your neighbor,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t betray the confidence of another;</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> lest one who hears it put you to shame,<br/>
<span class="indented">and your bad reputation never depart.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> A word fitly spoken<br/>
<span class="indented">is like apples of gold in settings of silver.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold,<br/>
<span class="indented">so is a wise reprover to an obedient ear.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> As the cold of snow in the time of harvest,<br/>
<span class="indented">so is a faithful messenger to those who send him;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for he refreshes the soul of his masters.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> As clouds and wind without rain,<br/>
<span class="indented">so is he who boasts of gifts deceptively.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 39:19–35 is already covered in Day 45, so continuing with Sirach 40 was Day 46, Sirach 41 is Day 47, etc. Let's proceed accordingly. -->
<!-- But per the reading plan, Day 47 calls for Sirach 41. -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 41</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> O death, how bitter is the remembrance of you<br/>
<span class="indented">to a man who is at peace in his possessions,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">to the man who has nothing to distract him,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and has prosperity in all things,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and still is strong to take food!</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> O death, how acceptable is your sentence to a man who is needy,<br/>
<span class="indented">and who fails in strength,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">who is in extreme old age,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and is distracted about everything;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">to one who waits, and distrusts,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and has lost patience!</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Don’t fear the sentence of death.<br/>
<span class="indented">Remember those who have been before you and that come after;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">this is the sentence from the Lord over all flesh.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> And why do you refuse the good pleasure of the Most High?<br/>
<span class="indented">Whether life is ten or a hundred or a thousand years,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">there is no inquisition about life in Sheol.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> The children of sinners are abominable children,<br/>
<span class="indented">and they frequent the dwellings of the ungodly.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> The inheritance of sinners’ children will perish,<br/>
<span class="indented">and their posterity will have a perpetual reproach.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Children will complain of an ungodly father,<br/>
<span class="indented">because they will be reproached for his sake.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Woe to you, ungodly men,<br/>
<span class="indented">who have forsaken the law of the Most High God!</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> If you are born, you will be born to a curse;<br/>
<span class="indented">if you die, a curse will be your portion.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> All things that are of the earth return to the earth;<br/>
<span class="indented">so the ungodly go from a curse to destruction.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> The mourning of men is about their bodies;<br/>
<span class="indented">but an evil name of sinners will be blotted out.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Have regard to your name;<br/>
<span class="indented">for it remains with you longer than a thousand great treasures of gold.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> A good life has its number of days;<br/>
<span class="indented">but a good name endures forever.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> My children, keep discipline in peace;<br/>
<span class="indented">for wisdom that is hidden and a treasure that is not seen—</span><br/>
<span class="indented">what profit is in them both?</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> A man who hides his foolishness is better than a man who hides his wisdom.<br/>
<sup>16</sup> Therefore be ashamed according to my word;<br/>
<span class="indented">for it is not good to keep every kind of shame,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and not all things are approved by all in truth.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Be ashamed of prostitution before father and mother;<br/>
<span class="indented">of a lie before a prince or a mighty man;</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> of an offense before a judge or ruler;<br/>
<span class="indented">of iniquity before the congregation and the people;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">of injustice before a companion and friend;</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> and of theft in the place where you live.<br/>
<span class="indented">Be ashamed of the truth of God and his covenant;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">of leaning with your elbow at dinner;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">of scurrilous speech before friends.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">After you have chosen wise discipline, be ashamed.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Thus you will be truly modest,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and find favor in the sight of every man.</span> </p></section>

<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 117</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Praise the Lord, all you nations!<br/>
<span class="indented">Extol him, all you peoples!</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> For his loving kindness is great toward us.<br/>
<span class="indented">The Lord’s faithfulness endures forever.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Praise the Lord!</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 118</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good,<br/>
<span class="indented">for his loving kindness endures forever.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Let Israel now say<br/>
<span class="indented">that his loving kindness endures forever.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Let the house of Aaron now say<br/>
<span class="indented">that his loving kindness endures forever.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Now let those who fear the Lord say<br/>
<span class="indented">that his loving kindness endures forever.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Out of my distress, I called on the Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">The Lord answered me with freedom.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> The Lord is on my side. I will not be afraid.<br/>
<span class="indented">What can man do to me?</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> The Lord is on my side among those who help me.<br/>
<span class="indented">Therefore I will look in triumph at those who hate me.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> It is better to take refuge in the Lord<br/>
<span class="indented">than to put confidence in man.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> It is better to take refuge in the Lord<br/>
<span class="indented">than to put confidence in princes.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> All the nations surrounded me,<br/>
<span class="indented">but in the Lord’s name I cut them off.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> They surrounded me, yes, they surrounded me.<br/>
<span class="indented">In the Lord’s name I indeed cut them off.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> They surrounded me like bees.<br/>
<span class="indented">They are quenched like the burning thorns.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">In the Lord’s name I cut them off.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> You pushed me back hard, to make me fall,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the Lord helped me.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> The Lord is my strength and song.<br/>
<span class="indented">He has become my salvation.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of the righteous.<br/>
<span class="indented">“The right hand of the Lord does valiantly.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> The right hand of the Lord is exalted!<br/>
<span class="indented">The right hand of the Lord does valiantly!”</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> I will not die, but live,<br/>
<span class="indented">and declare the Lord’s works.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> The Lord has punished me severely,<br/>
<span class="indented">but he has not given me over to death.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> Open to me the gates of righteousness.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will enter into them. I will give thanks to the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> This is the gate of the Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">The righteous will enter into it.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> I will give thanks to you, for you have answered me,<br/>
<span class="indented">and have become my salvation.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> The stone which the builders rejected<br/>
<span class="indented">has become the cornerstone.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> This is the Lord’s doing.<br/>
<span class="indented">It is marvelous in our eyes.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> This is the day that the Lord has made.<br/>
<span class="indented">We will rejoice and be glad in it!</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> Save us now, we beg you, Lord!<br/>
<span class="indented">Lord, we beg you, send prosperity now.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> Blessed is he who comes in the Lord’s name!<br/>
<span class="indented">We have blessed you out of the Lord’s house.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> The Lord is God, and he has given us light.<br/>
<span class="indented">Bind the sacrifice with cords, even to the horns of the altar.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> You are my God, and I will give thanks to you.<br/>
<span class="indented">You are my God, I will exalt you.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> Oh give thanks to the Lord, for he is good,<br/>
<span class="indented">for his loving kindness endures forever.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 25:15–28 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 25:15–28</h4>
<p>
<sup>15</sup> By patience a ruler is persuaded.<br/>
<span class="indented">A soft tongue breaks the bone.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Have you found honey?<br/>
<span class="indented">Eat as much as is sufficient for you,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">lest you eat too much, and vomit it.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor’s house,<br/>
<span class="indented">lest he be weary of you, and hate you.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> A man who gives false testimony against his neighbor<br/>
<span class="indented">is like a club, a sword, or a sharp arrow.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> Confidence in someone unfaithful in time of trouble<br/>
<span class="indented">is like a bad tooth or a lame foot.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> As one who takes away a garment in cold weather,<br/>
<span class="indented">or vinegar on soda,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">so is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat.<br/>
<span class="indented">If he is thirsty, give him water to drink,</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> for you will heap coals of fire on his head,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the Lord will reward you.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> The north wind produces rain;<br/>
<span class="indented">so a backbiting tongue brings an angry face.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop,<br/>
<span class="indented">than to share a house with a contentious woman.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> Like cold water to a thirsty soul,<br/>
<span class="indented">so is good news from a far country.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> Like a muddied spring and a polluted well,<br/>
<span class="indented">so is a righteous man who gives way before the wicked.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> It is not good to eat much honey,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor is it honorable to seek one’s own honor.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> Like a city that is broken down and without walls<br/>
<span class="indented">is a man whose spirit is without restraint.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 42 -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 42</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Of these things don’t be ashamed:<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t sin to save face:</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> of the law of the Most High and his covenant,<br/>
<span class="indented">of judgment to do justice,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">of reckoning with a partner and traveling companions,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">of a gift from the inheritance of friends;</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> of exactness of balance and weights,<br/>
<span class="indented">of getting much or little;</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> of bargaining in dealing with a merchant,<br/>
<span class="indented">of frequent correction of children,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and of making the sides of a wicked servant to bleed.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Where there is an evil wife, a seal is good;<br/>
<span class="indented">and where there are many hands, lock things up.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Whatever you deliver out, do it by number and weight;<br/>
<span class="indented">put all in writing that you give out or take in.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Don’t be ashamed to instruct the unwise and foolish,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the extremely aged who contends with those young in years;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">so you will be truly instructed,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and approved in the sight of every man.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> A daughter is a secret cause of wakefulness to a father;<br/>
<span class="indented">the care for her takes away sleep;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">in her youth, lest she pass the flower of her age;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and when she is married, lest she be hated;</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> in her virginity, lest she be defiled,<br/>
<span class="indented">or get with child in her father’s house;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and having a husband, lest she transgress;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">or, being married, lest she be barren.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Keep a strict watch over a headstrong daughter,<br/>
<span class="indented">lest she find liberty for herself, and use it.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Beware of all women who prostitute themselves,<br/>
<span class="indented">lest you make your own children fall into destruction,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and your family line suffer.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Don’t gaze at every pretty woman,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t sit in the midst of women.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> For from garments comes the moth,<br/>
<span class="indented">and from a woman a woman’s wickedness.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Better is the wickedness of a man than a woman who does good,<br/>
<span class="indented">and it is a woman who brings shame and reproach.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> I will now remember the works of the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">and declare the things that I have seen.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">The Lord’s works are in his words.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> The sun that gives light looks on all things;<br/>
<span class="indented">the Lord’s work is full of his glory.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> The Lord has not given power to the saints to declare all his marvelous works,<br/>
<span class="indented">which the Almighty Lord firmly settled,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">that the universe might stand firm in his glory.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> He searches out the deep, the heart,<br/>
<span class="indented">and he has understanding of their cunning devices;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for the Most High knows all knowledge,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and sees into the signs of the world,</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> declaring the things that are past and the things that are to come,<br/>
<span class="indented">and revealing the traces of hidden things.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> No thought escapes him.<br/>
<span class="indented">Not one word is hidden from him.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> He has ordered the mighty works of his wisdom.<br/>
<span class="indented">He is from everlasting to everlasting.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Nothing has been added,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">nor diminished,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and he has no need of any counselor.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> How desirable are all his works!<br/>
<span class="indented">One may see this even to a spark.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> All these things live and remain forever in all uses,<br/>
<span class="indented">and they are all obedient.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> All things are in pairs, one opposite the other;<br/>
<span class="indented">he has made nothing imperfect.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> One thing establishes the good things of another;<br/>
<span class="indented">who could ever see enough of his glory?</span> </p></section>

<h4>Psalm 119:1–48</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Blessed are those whose ways are blameless,<br/>
<span class="indented">who walk according to the Lord’s law.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Blessed are those who keep his statutes,<br/>
<span class="indented">who seek him with their whole heart.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Yes, they do nothing wrong.<br/>
<span class="indented">They walk in his ways.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> You have commanded your precepts,<br/>
<span class="indented">that we should fully obey them.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Oh that my ways were steadfast<br/>
<span class="indented">to obey your statutes!</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Then I wouldn’t be disappointed,<br/>
<span class="indented">when I consider all of your commandments.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> I will give thanks to you with uprightness of heart,<br/>
<span class="indented">when I learn your righteous judgments.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> I will observe your statutes.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t utterly forsake me.</span><br/>

<sup>9</sup> How can a young man keep his way pure?<br/>
<span class="indented">By living according to your word.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> With my whole heart, I have sought you.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t let me wander from your commandments.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> I have hidden your word in my heart,<br/>
<span class="indented">that I might not sin against you.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Blessed are you, Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">Teach me your statutes.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> With my lips, I have declared all the ordinances of your mouth.<br/>
<sup>14</sup> I have rejoiced in the way of your testimonies,<br/>

<span class="indented">for I have kept your statutes.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Though princes sit and slander me,<br/>
<span class="indented">your servant will meditate on your statutes.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> Indeed your statutes are my delight,<br/>
<span class="indented">and my counselors.</span><br/>
<br/>
<sup>25</sup> My soul is laid low in the dust.<br/>
<span class="indented">Revive me according to your word!</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> I declared my ways, and you answered me.<br/>
<span class="indented">Teach me your statutes.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> Let me understand the teaching of your precepts.<br/>
<span class="indented">Then I will meditate on your wondrous works.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> My soul is weary with sorrow;<br/>
<span class="indented">strengthen me according to your word.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> Keep me from the way of deceit.<br/>
<span class="indented">Grant me your law graciously!</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> I have chosen the way of truth.<br/>
<span class="indented">I have set your ordinances before me.</span><br/>
<sup>31</sup> I cling to your statutes, Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t let me be disappointed.</span><br/>
<sup>32</sup> I run in the path of your commandments,<br/>
<span class="indented">for you have set my heart free.</span><br/>
<br/>
<sup>33</sup> Teach me, Lord, the way of your statutes.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will keep them to the end.</span><br/>
<sup>34</sup> Give me understanding, and I will keep your law.<br/>
<span class="indented">Yes, I will obey it with my whole heart.</span><br/>
<sup>35</sup> Direct me in the path of your commandments,<br/>
<span class="indented">for I delight in them.</span><br/>
<sup>36</sup> Turn my heart toward your statutes,<br/>
<span class="indented">not toward selfish gain.</span><br/>
<sup>37</sup> Turn my eyes away from looking at worthless things.<br/>
<span class="indented">Revive me in your ways.</span><br/>
<sup>38</sup> Fulfill your promise to your servant,<br/>
<span class="indented">that you may be feared.</span><br/>
<sup>39</sup> Take away my disgrace that I dread,<br/>
<span class="indented">for your ordinances are good.</span><br/>
<sup>40</sup> Behold, I long for your precepts!<br/>
<span class="indented">Revive me in your righteousness.</span><br/>
<br/>
<sup>41</sup> Let your loving kindness also come to me, Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">your salvation, according to your word.</span><br/>
<sup>42</sup> So I will have an answer for him who reproaches me,<br/>
<span class="indented">for I trust in your word.</span><br/>
<sup>43</sup> Don’t snatch the word of truth out of my mouth,<br/>
<span class="indented">for I put my hope in your ordinances.</span><br/>
<sup>44</sup> So I will obey your law continually,<br/>
<span class="indented">forever and ever.</span><br/>
<sup>45</sup> I will walk in liberty,<br/>
<span class="indented">for I have sought your precepts.</span><br/>
<sup>46</sup> I will also speak of your statutes before kings,<br/>

<sup>47</sup> I will delight myself in your commandments,<br/>
<span class="indented">because I love them.</span><br/>

<sup>3</sup> A whip is for the horse,<br/>
<span class="indented">a bridle for the donkey,</span><br/>

<sup>4</sup> Don’t answer a fool according to his folly,<br/>

<sup>2</sup> The sun when it appears, bringing tidings as it goes forth,<br/>

<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 119:49–88</h4>
<p>
<sup>49</sup> Remember your word to your servant,<br/>
<span class="indented">because you gave me hope.</span><br/>
<sup>50</sup> This is my comfort in my affliction,<br/>
<span class="indented">for your word has revived me.</span><br/>
<sup>51</sup> The arrogant mock me excessively,<br/>
<span class="indented">but I don’t turn away from your law.</span><br/>
<sup>52</sup> I remember your ordinances of old, Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">and have comforted myself.</span><br/>
<sup>53</sup> Indignation has taken hold on me,<br/>
<span class="indented">because of the wicked who forsake your law.</span><br/>
<sup>54</sup> Your statutes have been my songs<br/>
<span class="indented">in the house where I live.</span><br/>
<sup>55</sup> I have remembered your name, Lord, in the night,<br/>
<span class="indented">and I obey your law.</span><br/>
<sup>56</sup> This is my way,<br/>
<span class="indented">that I keep your precepts.</span><br/>
<br/>
<sup>57</sup> The Lord is my portion.<br/>
<span class="indented">I promised to obey your words.</span><br/>
<sup>58</sup> I sought your favor with my whole heart.<br/>
<span class="indented">Be merciful to me according to your word.</span><br/>
<sup>59</sup> I considered my ways,<br/>
<span class="indented">and turned my steps to your statutes.</span><br/>
<sup>60</sup> I will hurry, and not delay,<br/>
<span class="indented">to obey your commandments.</span><br/>
<sup>61</sup> The ropes of the wicked bind me,<br/>
<span class="indented">but I won’t forget your law.</span><br/>
<sup>62</sup> At midnight I will rise to give thanks to you,<br/>
<span class="indented">because of your righteous ordinances.</span><br/>
<sup>63</sup> I am a friend of all those who fear you,<br/>
<span class="indented">of those who observe your precepts.</span><br/>
<sup>64</sup> The earth is full of your loving kindness, Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">Teach me your statutes.</span><br/>
<br/>
<sup>65</sup> Do good to your servant,<br/>
<span class="indented">according to your word, Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>66</sup> Teach me good judgment and knowledge,<br/>
<span class="indented">for I believe in your commandments.</span><br/>
<sup>67</sup> Before I was afflicted, I went astray;<br/>
<span class="indented">but now I observe your word.</span><br/>
<sup>68</sup> You are good, and do good.<br/>
<span class="indented">Teach me your statutes.</span><br/>
<sup>69</sup> The proud have smeared a lie upon me.<br/>
<span class="indented">With my whole heart, I will keep your precepts.</span><br/>
<sup>70</sup> Their heart is as callous as the fat,<br/>
<span class="indented">but I delight in your law.</span><br/>
<sup>71</sup> It is good for me that I have been afflicted,<br/>
<span class="indented">that I may learn your statutes.</span><br/>
<sup>72</sup> The law of your mouth is better to me than thousands of pieces of gold and silver.<br/>
<br/>
<sup>73</sup> Your hands have made me and formed me.<br/>
<span class="indented">Give me understanding, that I may learn your commandments.</span><br/>
<sup>74</sup> Those who fear you will see me and be glad,<br/>
<span class="indented">because I have put my hope in your word.</span><br/>
<sup>75</sup> Lord, I know that your judgments are righteous,<br/>
<span class="indented">that in faithfulness you have afflicted me.</span><br/>
<sup>76</sup> Please let your loving kindness be for my comfort,<br/>
<span class="indented">according to your word to your servant.</span><br/>
<sup>77</sup> Let your tender mercies come to me, that I may live;<br/>
<span class="indented">for your law is my delight.</span><br/>
<sup>78</sup> Let the proud be disappointed, for they have overthrown me wrongfully.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will meditate on your precepts.</span><br/>
<sup>79</sup> Let those who fear you turn to me.<br/>
<span class="indented">They will know your statutes.</span><br/>
<sup>80</sup> Let my heart be blameless toward your decrees,<br/>
<span class="indented">that I may not be disappointed.</span><br/>
<br/>
<sup>81</sup> My soul faints for your salvation.<br/>
<span class="indented">I hope in your word.</span><br/>
<sup>82</sup> My eyes fail for your word.<br/>
<span class="indented">I say, “When will you comfort me?”</span><br/>
<sup>83</sup> For I have become like a wineskin in the smoke.<br/>
<span class="indented">I don’t forget your statutes.</span><br/>
<sup>84</sup> How many are the days of your servant?<br/>
<span class="indented">When will you execute judgment on those who persecute me?</span><br/>
<sup>85</sup> The proud have dug pits for me,<br/>
<span class="indented">contrary to your law.</span><br/>
<sup>86</sup> All of your commandments are faithful.<br/>
<span class="indented">They persecute me wrongfully.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Help me!</span><br/>
<sup>87</sup> They had almost wiped me from the earth,<br/>
<span class="indented">but I didn’t forsake your precepts.</span><br/>
<sup>88</sup> Preserve my life according to your loving kindness,<br/>
<span class="indented">so I will obey the statutes of your mouth.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 26:16–28 -->

<h4>Proverbs 26:16–28</h4>
<p>
<sup>16</sup> The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes<br/>
<span class="indented">than seven men who answer with discretion.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Like one who grabs a dog’s ears<br/>
<span class="indented">is one who passes by and meddles in a quarrel not his own.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> Like a madman who shoots firebrands, arrows, and death,<br/>
<sup>19</sup> is the man who deceives his neighbor and says,<br/>
<span class="indented">“Am I not joking?”</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> For lack of wood a fire goes out.<br/>
<span class="indented">Without gossip, a quarrel dies down.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> As coals are to hot embers, and wood to fire,<br/>
<span class="indented">so is a contentious man to kindling strife.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels,<br/>
<span class="indented">they go down into the innermost parts.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Like silver dross on an earthen vessel<br/>
<span class="indented">are the lips of a fervent one with an evil heart.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> A malicious man disguises himself with his lips,<br/>
<span class="indented">but he harbors evil in his heart.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> When his speech is charming, don’t believe him;<br/>
<span class="indented">for there are seven abominations in his heart.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> His malice may be concealed by deception,<br/>
<span class="indented">but his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> Whoever digs a pit shall fall into it.<br/>
<span class="indented">Whoever rolls a stone, it will come back on him.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> A lying tongue hates those it hurts,<br/>
<span class="indented">and a flattering mouth works ruin.</span> </p>

<span class="indented">You have established the earth, and it remains.</span><br/>
<sup>91</sup> Your laws remain to this day,<br/>
<span class="indented">for all things serve you.</span><br/>
<sup>92</sup> Unless your law had been my delight,<br/>
<span class="indented">I would have perished in my affliction.</span><br/>
<sup>93</sup> I will never forget your precepts,<br/>
<span class="indented">for with them, you have revived me.</span><br/>
<sup>94</sup> I am yours. Save me;<br/>

<br/>
<sup>97</sup> How I love your law!<br/>
<span class="indented">It is my meditation all day.</span><br/>
<sup>98</sup> Your commandments make me wiser than my enemies,<br/>
<span class="indented">for your commandments are always with me.</span><br/>
<sup>99</sup> I have more understanding than all my teachers,<br/>
<span class="indented">for your testimonies are my meditation.</span><br/>
<sup>100</sup> I understand more than the aged,<br/>
<span class="indented">because I have kept your precepts.</span><br/>
<sup>101</sup> I have kept my feet from every evil way,<br/>
<span class="indented">that I might observe your word.</span><br/>
<sup>102</sup> I have not turned away from your ordinances,<br/>

<sup>103</sup> How sweet are your promises to my taste,<br/>
<span class="indented">more than honey to my mouth!</span><br/>
<sup>104</sup> Through your precepts, I get understanding;<br/>
<span class="indented">therefore I hate every false way.</span><br/>
<br/>
<sup>105</sup> Your word is a lamp to my feet,<br/>
<span class="indented">and a light for my path.</span><br/>

<span class="indented">that I will obey your righteous ordinances.</span><br/>
<sup>107</sup> I am afflicted very much.<br/>
<span class="indented">Revive me, Lord, according to your word.</span><br/>

<span class="indented">even to the end.</span><br/>
<br/>
<sup>113</sup> I hate double-minded men,<br/>
<span class="indented">but I love your law.</span><br/>
<sup>114</sup> You are my hiding place and my shield.<br/>
<span class="indented">I hope in your word.</span><br/>
<sup>115</sup> Depart from me, you evildoers,<br/>
<span class="indented">that I may keep the commandments of my God.</span><br/>
<sup>116</sup> Uphold me according to your word, that I may live.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let me not be ashamed of my hope.</span><br/>
<sup>117</sup> Hold me up, and I will be safe,<br/>
<span class="indented">and will have respect for your statutes continually.</span><br/>
<sup>118</sup> You reject all those who stray from your statutes,<br/>
<span class="indented">for their deceit is in vain.</span><br/>
<sup>119</sup> You put away all the wicked of the earth like dross.<br/>
<span class="indented">Therefore I love your testimonies.</span><br/>
<sup>120</sup> My flesh trembles for fear of you.<br/>
<span class="indented">I am afraid of your judgments.</span><br/>
<br/>
<sup>121</sup> I have done what is just and righteous.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t leave me to my oppressors.</span><br/>

<sup>123</sup> My eyes fail looking for your salvation,<br/>
<span class="indented">for your righteous word.</span><br/>
<sup>124</sup> Deal with your servant according to your loving kindness.<br/>
<span class="indented">Teach me your statutes.</span><br/>
<sup>125</sup> I am your servant. Give me understanding,<br/>
<span class="indented">that I may know your testimonies.</span><br/>
<sup>126</sup> It is time to act, Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">for they break your law.</span><br/>
<sup>127</sup> Therefore I love your commandments more than gold,<br/>
<span class="indented">yes, more than pure gold.</span><br/>
<sup>128</sup> Therefore I consider all of your precepts to be right.<br/>
<span class="indented">I hate every false way.</span><br/>
<br/>
<sup>129</sup> Your testimonies are wonderful,<br/>
<span class="indented">therefore my soul keeps them.</span><br/>
<sup>130</sup> The entrance of your words gives light.<br/>
<span class="indented">It gives understanding to the simple.</span><br/>
<sup>131</sup> I opened my mouth wide and panted,<br/>
<span class="indented">for I longed for your commandments.</span><br/>
<sup>132</sup> Turn to me, and have mercy on me,<br/>
<span class="indented">as you always do to those who love your name.</span><br/>
<sup>133</sup> Establish my footsteps in your word.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t let any iniquity have dominion over me.</span><br/>
<sup>134</sup> Redeem me from the oppression of man,<br/>
<span class="indented">so I will observe your precepts.</span><br/>
<sup>135</sup> Make your face shine on your servant.<br/>
<span class="indented">Teach me your statutes.</span><br/>

<h4>Proverbs 27:1–13</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Don’t boast about tomorrow;<br/>
<span class="indented">for you don’t know what a day may bring.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Let another man praise you,<br/>
<span class="indented">and not your own mouth;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">a stranger, and not your own lips.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> A stone is heavy, and sand is a burden;<br/>
<span class="indented">but a fool’s provocation is heavier than both.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Wrath is cruel,<br/>
<span class="indented">and anger is overwhelming;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">but who is able to stand before jealousy?</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Better is open rebuke<br/>
<span class="indented">than hidden love.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> The wounds of a friend are faithful,<br/>
<span class="indented">although the kisses of an enemy are profuse.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> A full soul loathes a honeycomb;<br/>
<span class="indented">but to a hungry soul, every bitter thing is sweet.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> As a bird that wanders from her nest,<br/>
<span class="indented">so is a man who wanders from his home.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart;<br/>
<span class="indented">so does earnest counsel from a man’s friend.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Don’t forsake your friend and your father’s friend.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t go to your brother’s house in the day of your disaster.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">A neighbor who is near is better than a distant brother.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Be wise, my son,<br/>
<span class="indented">and bring joy to my heart,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">then I can answer my tormentor.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> A prudent man sees danger and takes refuge;<br/>
<span class="indented">but the simple pass on, and suffer for it.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Take his garment when he puts up collateral for a stranger.<br/>
<span class="indented">Hold it for a wayward woman!</span> </p> <!-- (No Sirach reading for Day 51) -->

<p>
<sup>13</sup> By his command he makes the snow fall,<br/>
<span class="indented">and speeds the lightning of his judgment.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Therefore the storehouses are opened,<br/>
<span class="indented">and clouds fly out like birds.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> By his great power he makes the clouds firm,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the hailstones are broken.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> At his sight the mountains are shaken,<br/>
<span class="indented">and at his will the south wind blows.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> The voice of his thunder rebukes the earth.<br/>
<span class="indented">So does the storm from the north, and the whirlwind of the south.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> He scatters the snow like birds flying down.<br/>
<span class="indented">Its descent is like the coming down of locusts.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> The eye marvels at the beauty of its whiteness,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the heart is astonished at its raining down.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> He also pours the hoarfrost on the earth like salt.<br/>
<span class="indented">When it is frozen, it becomes pointed thorns.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> The cold north wind blows,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the water congeals into ice.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">It settles on every pool of water,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and the water puts it on like a breastplate.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> It devours the mountains,<br/>
<span class="indented">and burns up the wilderness,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and consumes the grass like fire.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> A swift remedy for all is the pouring out of dew.<br/>
<span class="indented">A refreshing after the heat by the weather changes.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> By his counsel he has stilled the deep<br/>
<span class="indented">and planted islands in it.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> Those who sail on the sea tell of its danger,<br/>
<span class="indented">and when we hear it with our ears, we marvel.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> There are also those strange and wondrous works,<br/>
<span class="indented">varieties of all living things and the monstrous creatures of the sea.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> Because of him his messenger prospers,<br/>
<span class="indented">and by his word all things hold together.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> We may say many things, but we can’t say enough.<br/>
<span class="indented">The sum of our words is, “He is the all.”</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> How shall we have the strength to glorify him?<br/>
<span class="indented">For he is himself the great above all his works.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> The Lord is awesome and exceedingly great,<br/>
<span class="indented">and his power is marvelous.</span><br/>
<sup>31</sup> Glorify the Lord, and exalt him as much as you can.<br/>
<span class="indented">For even yet you will fail;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and when you exalt him, summon all your strength, and don’t be weary;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for you will never comprehend.</span><br/>
<sup>32</sup> Who has seen him, that he may describe him?<br/>
<span class="indented">Who can magnify him as he is?</span><br/>
<sup>33</sup> Many things are hidden greater than these;<br/>
<span class="indented">for we have seen but a few of his works.</span><br/>
<sup>34</sup> For the Lord made all things,<br/>
<span class="indented">and to the godly he gives wisdom.</span> </p></section>

<sup>21</sup> The crucible is for silver, and the furnace for gold;<br/>
<span class="indented">but man is refined by his praise.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> Though you grind a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with grain,<br/>
<span class="indented">yet his foolishness will not be removed from him.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Know well the state of your flocks,<br/>
<span class="indented">and pay attention to your herds;</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> for riches are not forever,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor does even the crown endure to all generations.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> The hay is removed, and the new growth appears.<br/>
<span class="indented">The grasses of the hills are gathered in.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> The lambs are for your clothing,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the goats are the price of a field.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> There will be plenty of goats’ milk for your food,<br/>
<span class="indented">for your family’s food,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and for the nourishment of your servant girls.</span> </p> <!-- (No Sirach reading for Day 52) -->

<!-- Psalms 120, 121, 122, 123, 124 -->
<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 120</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> In my distress, I cried to the Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">He answered me.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Deliver my soul, Lord, from lying lips,<br/>
<span class="indented">from a deceitful tongue.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> What will be given to you, and what will be done more to you,<br/>
<span class="indented">you deceitful tongue?</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Sharp arrows of the mighty,<br/>
<span class="indented">with coals of juniper.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Woe is me, that I live in Meshech,<br/>
<span class="indented">that I dwell among the tents of Kedar!</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> My soul has had her dwelling too long<br/>
<span class="indented">with him who hates peace.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> I am for peace,<br/>
<span class="indented">but when I speak, they are for war.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 121</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> I will lift up my eyes to the hills.<br/>
<span class="indented">Where does my help come from?</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> My help comes from the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">who made heaven and earth.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> He will not allow your foot to be moved.<br/>
<span class="indented">He who keeps you will not slumber.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Behold, he who keeps Israel<br/>
<span class="indented">will neither slumber nor sleep.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> The Lord is your keeper.<br/>
<span class="indented">The Lord is your shade on your right hand.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> The sun will not harm you by day,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor the moon by night.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> The Lord will keep you from all evil.<br/>
<span class="indented">He will keep your soul.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> The Lord will keep your going out and your coming in,<br/>
<span class="indented">from this time forward, and forever more.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 122</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> I was glad when they said to me,<br/>
<span class="indented">“Let’s go to the Lord’s house!”</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Our feet are standing within your gates, Jerusalem,<br/>
<sup>3</sup> Jerusalem, that is built as a city that is compact together,<br/>
<sup>4</sup> where the tribes go up, even the Lord’s tribes,<br/>
<span class="indented">according to an ordinance for Israel,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">to give thanks to the Lord’s name.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> For there are set thrones for judgment,<br/>
<span class="indented">the thrones of David’s house.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Pray for the peace of Jerusalem.<br/>
<span class="indented">Those who love you will prosper.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Peace be within your walls,<br/>
<span class="indented">and prosperity within your palaces.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> For my brothers’ and companions’ sakes,<br/>
<span class="indented">I will now say, “Peace be within you.”</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> For the sake of the house of the Lord our God,<br/>
<span class="indented">I will seek your good.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 123</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> I lift up my eyes to you,<br/>
<span class="indented">you who sit in the heavens.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master,<br/>
<span class="indented">as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">so our eyes look to the Lord our God,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">until he has mercy on us.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Have mercy on us, Lord, have mercy on us,<br/>
<span class="indented">for we have endured much contempt.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scoffing of those who are at ease,<br/>
<span class="indented">with the contempt of the proud.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 124</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> If it had not been the Lord who was on our side,<br/>
<span class="indented">let Israel now say,</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> if it had not been the Lord who was on our side,<br/>
<span class="indented">when men rose up against us;</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> then they would have swallowed us up alive,<br/>
<span class="indented">when their wrath was kindled against us;</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> then the waters would have overwhelmed us,<br/>
<span class="indented">the stream would have gone over our soul;</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> then the proud waters would have gone over our soul.<br/>
<sup>6</sup> Blessed be the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">who has not given us as a prey to their teeth.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Our soul has escaped like a bird out of the fowler’s snare.<br/>
<span class="indented">The snare is broken, and we have escaped.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Our help is in the Lord’s name,<br/>
<span class="indented">who made heaven and earth.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 28:1–14 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 28:1–14</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> The wicked flee when no one pursues;<br/>
<span class="indented">but the righteous are as bold as a lion.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> In rebellion, a land has many rulers,<br/>
<span class="indented">but order is maintained by a man of understanding and knowledge.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> A needy man who oppresses the poor<br/>
<span class="indented">is like a driving rain which leaves no crops.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Those who forsake the law praise the wicked;<br/>
<span class="indented">but those who keep the law contend with them.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Evil men don’t understand justice;<br/>
<span class="indented">but those who seek the Lord understand it fully.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Better is the poor who walks in his integrity<br/>
<span class="indented">than he who is perverse in his ways, and he is rich.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Whoever keeps the law is a wise son,<br/>
<span class="indented">but he who is a companion of gluttons shames his father.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> He who increases his wealth by excessive interest<br/>
<span class="indented">gathers it for one who has pity on the poor.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> He who turns away his ear from hearing the law,<br/>
<span class="indented">even his prayer is an abomination.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Whoever causes the upright to go astray in an evil way,<br/>
<span class="indented">he will fall into his own trap;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">but the blameless will inherit good.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> The rich man is wise in his own eyes;<br/>
<span class="indented">but the poor who has understanding sees through him.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> When the righteous triumph, there is great glory;<br/>
<span class="indented">but when the wicked rise, men hide themselves.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> He who conceals his sins doesn’t prosper,<br/>
<span class="indented">but whoever confesses and renounces them finds mercy.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Blessed is the man who always fears;<br/>
<span class="indented">but one who hardens his heart falls into trouble.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 44 -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 44</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Let us now praise famous men,<br/>
<span class="indented">and our fathers who became the parents of us.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> The Lord has done great glory by them through his great power<br/>
<span class="indented">from the beginning.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> They ruled in their kingdoms,<br/>
<span class="indented">men renowned for their power,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">giving counsel by their understanding,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and proclaiming prophecies;</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> leaders of the people by their counsels,<br/>
<span class="indented">and by their understanding, learning fit for the people;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">wise words in their writings;</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> men of skill in music,<br/>
<span class="indented">and setting verses in writing;</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> rich men furnished with resources,<br/>
<span class="indented">living peaceably in their habitations—</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> all these were honored in their generations,<br/>
<span class="indented">and were a glory in their days.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Some of them have left a name behind them,<br/>
<span class="indented">that their praises might be reported.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Some there are who have no memorial,<br/>
<span class="indented">who have perished as though they had not lived;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and become as though they had not been born,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and their children after them.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> But these were men of mercy,<br/>
<span class="indented">whose righteous deeds have not been forgotten.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Their offspring will continue forever.<br/>
<span class="indented">Their glory will not be blotted out.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Their bodies were buried in peace,<br/>
<span class="indented">and their name lives to all generations.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Peoples will declare their wisdom,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the congregation tells out their praise.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Enoch pleased the Lord, and was translated,<br/>
<span class="indented">being an example of repentance to all generations.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Noah was found perfect and righteous.<br/>
<span class="indented">In the time of wrath, he was taken in exchange for the world;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">therefore a remnant was left to the earth when the flood came.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Everlasting covenants were made with him,<br/>
<span class="indented">that all flesh should no more be blotted out by a flood.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Abraham was a great father of many nations.<br/>
<span class="indented">His glory was more than that of any other ancestor.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> In the covenant with him, his flesh was put to the test.<br/>
<span class="indented">When he was tested, he was found faithful.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> Therefore God assured him by an oath<br/>
<span class="indented">that he would bless the nations in his offspring;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">that he would multiply him like the dust of the earth,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">exalt his offspring like the stars,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and cause them to inherit from sea to sea,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and from the River to the utmost parts of the land.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> In Isaac, he established likewise, for Abraham his father’s sake,<br/>
<span class="indented">a blessing for all men and the covenant.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> He made it rest upon the head of Jacob.<br/>
<span class="indented">He acknowledged him in his blessings,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">gave him an inheritance,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and divided his portions among twelve tribes.</span> </p></section>

<!-- Psalms 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131 -->
<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 125</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Those who trust in the Lord are as Mount Zion,<br/>
<span class="indented">which can’t be moved, but remains forever.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> As the mountains surround Jerusalem,<br/>
<span class="indented">so the Lord surrounds his people from this time forward and forever more.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> For the scepter of wickedness won’t remain over the allotment of the righteous,<br/>
<span class="indented">so that the righteous won’t use their hands to do evil.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Do good, Lord, to those who are good,<br/>
<span class="indented">to those who are upright in their hearts.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> But as for those who turn away to their crooked ways,<br/>
<span class="indented">the Lord will lead them away with the workers of iniquity.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Peace be on Israel.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 126</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> When the Lord brought back those who returned to Zion,<br/>
<span class="indented">we were like those who dream.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Then our mouth was filled with laughter,<br/>
<span class="indented">and our tongue with singing.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Then they said among the nations,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">“The Lord has done great things for them.”</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> The Lord has done great things for us,<br/>
<span class="indented">and we are glad.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Restore our fortunes again, Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">like the streams in the Negev.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Those who sow in tears will reap in joy.<br/>
<sup>6</sup> He who goes out weeping, carrying seed for sowing,<br/>
<span class="indented">will certainly come again with joy, carrying his sheaves.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 127</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Unless the Lord builds the house,<br/>
<span class="indented">they labor in vain who build it.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Unless the Lord watches over the city,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">the watchman guards it in vain.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> It is vain for you to rise up early, to stay up late,<br/>
<span class="indented">eating the bread of toil;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for he gives sleep to his loved ones.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Behold, children are a heritage of the Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">The fruit of the womb is his reward.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> As arrows in the hand of a mighty man,<br/>
<span class="indented">so are the children of youth.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them.<br/>
<span class="indented">They won’t be disappointed when they speak with their enemies in the gate.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 128</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Blessed is everyone who fears the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">who walks in his ways.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> For you will eat the labor of your hands.<br/>
<span class="indented">You will be happy, and it will be well with you.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Your wife will be as a fruitful vine<br/>
<span class="indented">in the innermost parts of your house;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">your children like olive shoots around your table.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Behold, thus is the man blessed who fears the Lord.<br/>
<sup>5</sup> May the Lord bless you out of Zion,<br/>
<span class="indented">and may you see the good of Jerusalem all the days of your life.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Yes, may you see your children’s children.<br/>
<span class="indented">Peace be upon Israel.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 129</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Many times they have afflicted me from my youth up.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let Israel now say,</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> many times they have afflicted me from my youth up,<br/>
<span class="indented">yet they have not prevailed against me.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> The plowers plowed on my back.<br/>
<span class="indented">They made their furrows long.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> The Lord is righteous.<br/>
<span class="indented">He has cut apart the cords of the wicked.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Let them be disappointed and turned backward,<br/>
<span class="indented">all those who hate Zion.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Let them be as the grass on the housetops,<br/>
<span class="indented">which withers before it grows up;</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> with which the reaper doesn’t fill his hand,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor he who binds sheaves, his bosom.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Neither do those who go by say,<br/>
<span class="indented">“The blessing of the Lord be on you.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">We bless you in the Lord’s name.”</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 130</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Out of the depths I have cried to you, Lord.<br/>
<sup>2</sup> Lord, hear my voice.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my petitions.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> If you, Lord, kept a record of sins,<br/>
<span class="indented">Lord, who could stand?</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> But there is forgiveness with you,<br/>
<span class="indented">therefore you are feared.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> I wait for the Lord. My soul waits.<br/>
<span class="indented">I hope in his word.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> My soul longs for the Lord more than watchmen long for the morning,<br/>
<span class="indented">more than watchmen for the morning.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Israel, hope in the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">for there is loving kindness with the Lord.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Abundant redemption is with him.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> He will redeem Israel from all their sins.
  </p>
<h4>Psalm 131</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Lord, my heart isn’t arrogant, nor my eyes lofty;<br/>
<span class="indented">nor do I concern myself with great matters,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">or things too wonderful for me.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul,<br/>
<span class="indented">like a weaned child with his mother,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">like a weaned child is my soul within me.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Israel, hope in the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">from this time forward and forever more.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 28:15–27 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 28:15–27</h4>
<p>
<sup>15</sup> As a roaring lion or a charging bear,<br/>
<span class="indented">so is a wicked ruler over helpless people.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> A tyrannical ruler lacks judgment.<br/>
<span class="indented">One who hates ill-gotten gain will have long days.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> A man who is tormented by life-blood will be a fugitive until death;<br/>
<span class="indented">no one will support him.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> Whoever walks blamelessly is kept safe,<br/>
<span class="indented">but one with perverse ways will fall suddenly.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> One who works his land will have an abundance of food;<br/>
<span class="indented">but one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> A faithful man is rich with blessings;<br/>
<span class="indented">but one who is eager to be rich will not go unpunished.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> To show partiality is not good;<br/>
<span class="indented">yet a man will do wrong for a piece of bread.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> A stingy man hurries after riches,<br/>
<span class="indented">and doesn’t know that poverty waits for him.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> One who rebukes a man will afterward find more favor<br/>
<span class="indented">than one who flatters with the tongue.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> Whoever robs his father or his mother, and says, “It’s not wrong,”<br/>
<span class="indented">is a partner with a destroyer.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> One who is greedy stirs up strife;<br/>
<span class="indented">but one who trusts in the Lord will prosper.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> One who trusts in himself is a fool,<br/>
<span class="indented">but one who walks in wisdom, he is kept safe.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> One who gives to the poor has no lack,<br/>
<span class="indented">but one who closes his eyes will have many curses.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 45 -->

<h4>Sirach 45</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> He brought out of him a merciful man,<br/>
<span class="indented">who found favor in the sight of all flesh,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">a man loved by God and men, Moses, whose memory is blessed.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> He made him equal to the saints in glory,<br/>
<span class="indented">and magnified him in the fears of his enemies.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> By his words, he caused signs to cease;<br/>
<span class="indented">the Lord glorified him in the presence of kings.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He gave him commandments for his people,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and showed him part of his glory.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> He sanctified him in his faithfulness and meekness.<br/>
<span class="indented">He chose him out of all men.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> He made him hear his voice,<br/>
<span class="indented">and led him into the thick darkness,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and gave him commandments face to face,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">even the law of life and knowledge,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">that he might teach Jacob the covenant,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and Israel his judgments.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> He exalted Aaron, a holy man like Moses,<br/>
<span class="indented">a brother of him, of the tribe of Levi.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> He established an everlasting covenant with him,<br/>
<span class="indented">and gave him the priesthood of the people.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He blessed him with majestic ornaments,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and girded him with splendid attire:</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> breeches, and a long robe, and the ephod.<br/>
<span class="indented">He encompassed him with pomegranates,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and with many golden bells all around,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">to send out a sound as he went,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">to make a sound in the temple for a memorial to the children of his people;</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> with a holy garment, with gold and blue silk,<br/>
<span class="indented">and purple, the work of the embroider;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">with an oracle of judgment, even the Urim and Thummim;</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> with twisted scarlet, the work of a craftsman;<br/>
<span class="indented">with precious stones engraved like a signet,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">in a setting of gold, the work of the jeweler,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for a memorial in engraved letters, according to the number of the tribes of Israel;</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> with a crown of gold upon the mitre,<br/>
<span class="indented">having engraved on it, as on a signet, “Holiness,”</span><br/>
<span class="indented">an ornament of honor, the work of an expert,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">the desires of the eyes, goodly and beautiful.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Before him, such beautiful things hadn’t existed.<br/>
<span class="indented">No outsider ever put them on,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">but only his children and his descendants perpetually.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> His sacrifices were wholly consumed twice every day continually.<br/>
<sup>14</sup> Moses consecrated him,<br/>
<span class="indented">and anointed him with holy oil.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">It was an everlasting covenant for him and for his descendants all the days of heaven,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">to minister to the Lord, and to serve as priest, and to bless his people in his name.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> He chose him out of all living to offer sacrifices to the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">incense, and a pleasant fragrance, for a memorial,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">to make reconciliation for his people.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> He gave to him his commandments,<br/>
<span class="indented">and authority in the statutes of judgments,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">that he might teach Jacob the testimonies,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and inform Israel in his law.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Strangers conspired together against him,<br/>
<span class="indented">and envied him in the wilderness:</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Dathan and Abiram with their company,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and the congregation of Korah, in wrath and anger.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> The Lord saw it, and it displeased him.<br/>
<span class="indented">They were consumed in his fierce wrath.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> He did wonders against them,<br/>
<span class="indented">to consume them with flaming fire.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> He added glory to Aaron,<br/>
<span class="indented">and gave him a heritage.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He allotted to him the first fruits of the first labor,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">especially prepared bread in abundance.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> For they eat the sacrifices of the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">which he gave to him and to his descendants.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> However, he has no inheritance in the land of the people,<br/>
<span class="indented">and he has no portion among the people;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for the Lord himself is his portion and inheritance.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Phinehas the son of Eleazar is the third in glory,<br/>
<span class="indented">in that he was zealous in the fear of the Lord,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and stood fast in the good forwardness of his soul when the people turned away,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and he made reconciliation for Israel.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> Therefore also a covenant of peace was established with him,<br/>
<span class="indented">that he should be leader of the sanctuary and of his people,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">that he and his descendants should have the dignity of the priesthood forever.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> Also he made a covenant with David the son of Jesse, of the tribe of Judah.<br/>
<span class="indented">The inheritance of the king is his alone from son to son;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">so the inheritance of Aaron is also to his descendants.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> May he give you wisdom in your heart to judge his people in righteousness,<br/>
<span class="indented">that their good things not be abolished,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and that their glory may endure forever.</span> </p></section>

<span class="indented">and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> “Surely I will not come into the structure of my house,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor go up into my bed;</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> I will not give sleep to my eyes,<br/>
<span class="indented">or slumber to my eyelids;</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> until I find a place for the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.”</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah.<br/>
<span class="indented">We found it in the field of Jaar:</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> “We will go into his dwelling place.<br/>
<span class="indented">We will worship at his footstool.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Arise, Lord, into your resting place;<br/>
<span class="indented">you, and the ark of your strength.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Let your priests be clothed with righteousness.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let your saints shout for joy!”</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> For your servant David’s sake,<br/>
<span class="indented">don’t turn away the face of your anointed one.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> The Lord has sworn to David in truth.<br/>
<span class="indented">He will not turn from it:</span><br/>
<span class="indented">“I will set the fruit of your body on your throne.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> If your children will keep my covenant,<br/>
<span class="indented">my testimony that I will teach them,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">their children also will sit on your throne forever more.”</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> For the Lord has chosen Zion.<br/>
<span class="indented">He has desired it for his habitation.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> “This is my resting place forever.<br/>
<span class="indented">Here I will live, for I have desired it.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> I will abundantly bless her provision.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will satisfy her poor with bread.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> I will also clothe her priests with salvation.<br/>
<span class="indented">Her saints will shout aloud for joy.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> I will make the horn of David to bud.<br/>
<span class="indented">I have ordained a lamp for my anointed.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> I will clothe his enemies with shame,<br/>
<span class="indented">but on himself, his crown will shine.”</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 133</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> See how good and how pleasant it is<br/>
<span class="indented">for brothers to live together in unity!</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> It is like the precious oil on the head,<br/>
<span class="indented">that ran down on the beard,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">even Aaron’s beard,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">that came down on the edge of his robes;</span><br/>

<span class="indented">that our Lord is above all gods.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Whatever the Lord pleased, that he has done,<br/>
<span class="indented">in heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps;</span><br/>

<span class="indented">who makes lightning with the rain;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">who brings the wind out of his treasuries;</span><br/>

<span class="indented">and all the kingdoms of Canaan—</span><br/>

<sup>13</sup> Your name, Lord, endures forever;<br/>
<span class="indented">your renown, Lord, throughout all generations.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> For the Lord will judge his people,<br/>
<span class="indented">and have compassion on his servants.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> The idols of the nations are silver and gold,<br/>
<span class="indented">the work of men’s hands.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> They have mouths, but they can’t speak.<br/>
<span class="indented">They have eyes, but they can’t see.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> They have ears, but they can’t hear.<br/>
<span class="indented">Neither is there any breath in their mouths.</span><br/>

<h4>Proverbs 29:1–14</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> He who is often rebuked and stiffens his neck<br/>
<span class="indented">will be destroyed suddenly, with no remedy.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> When the righteous thrive, the people rejoice;<br/>
<span class="indented">but when the wicked rule, the people groan.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Whoever loves wisdom brings joy to his father;<br/>
<span class="indented">but a companion of prostitutes squanders his wealth.</span><br/>

<span class="indented">but he who takes bribes tears it down.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> A man who flatters his neighbor<br/>
<span class="indented">spreads a net for his feet.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> An evil man is snared by his sin,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the righteous can sing and be glad.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> The righteous care about justice for the poor.<br/>
<span class="indented">The wicked aren’t concerned about knowledge.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Mockers stir up a city,<br/>
<span class="indented">but wise men turn away anger.</span><br/>

<sup>1</sup> Joshua the son of Nun was mighty in war,<br/>
<span class="indented">and was the successor of Moses in prophecies.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He became, according to his name, great for the saving of God’s elect,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">to take vengeance on the enemies that rose up against them,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">that he might give Israel their inheritance.</span><br/>

<span class="indented">For the Lord himself brought his enemies to him.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Didn’t the sun go back by his hand?<br/>
<span class="indented">Didn’t one day become as two?</span><br/>

<span class="indented">when his foes pressed him on every side;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and the great Lord heard him.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> With hailstones of mighty power<br/>
<span class="indented">he made war break violently on that nation,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and in the going down he destroyed those who resisted,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">that the nations might know his power,</span><br/>

<span class="indented">and he followed the Mighty One wholly.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Also in the time of Moses, he did a work of mercy—<br/>
<span class="indented">he and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">in that they withstood the adversary,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">hindered the people from sin,</span><br/>

<sup>8</sup> And of six hundred thousand people on foot,<br/>
<span class="indented">they two alone were preserved to bring them into the heritage,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">into a land flowing with milk and honey.</span><br/>

<sup>1</sup> By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down.<br/>
<span class="indented">Yes, we wept, when we remembered Zion.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> On the willows in that land,<br/>
<span class="indented">we hung up our harps.</span><br/>

<span class="indented">Those who tormented us demanded songs of joy:</span><br/>
<span class="indented">“Sing us one of the songs of Zion!”</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> How can we sing the Lord’s song in a foreign land?<br/>

<sup>6</sup> Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth if I don’t remember you,<br/>
<span class="indented">if I don’t prefer Jerusalem above my chief joy.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Remember, Lord, against the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem,<br/>
<span class="indented">who said, “Raze it! Raze it even to its foundation!”</span><br/>

<h4>Proverbs 29:15–27</h4>

<sup>15</sup> The rod of correction gives wisdom,<br/>

<span class="indented">but one who keeps the law is blessed.</span><br/>

<span class="indented">Though he understands, yet he will not respond.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> Do you see a man who is hasty in his words?<br/>
<span class="indented">There is more hope for a fool than for him.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> He who pampers his servant from youth<br/>
<span class="indented">will have him become a son in the end.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> An angry man stirs up strife,<br/>
<span class="indented">and a wrathful man abounds in sin.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> A man’s pride brings him low,<br/>
<span class="indented">but one of lowly spirit gains honor.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> Whoever is an accomplice of a thief is an enemy of his own soul.<br/>
<span class="indented">He takes an oath, but dares not testify.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> The fear of man proves to be a snare,<br/>
<span class="indented">but whoever puts his trust in the Lord is kept safe.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> Many seek the ruler’s favor,<br/>
<span class="indented">but a man’s justice comes from the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> A dishonest man detests the righteous,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the upright in their ways detest the wicked.</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 47 -->

<h4>Sirach 47</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> After him rose up Nathan<br/>
<span class="indented">to prophesy in the time of David.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> As is the fat taken away from the peace offering,<br/>
<span class="indented">so was David chosen out of the children of Israel.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> He played with lions as with kids,<br/>
<span class="indented">and with bears as with lambs of the flock.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> In his youth, he killed a giant,<br/>
<span class="indented">and took away reproach from the people,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">when he lifted up his hand with a stone in a sling,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and beat down the boasting of Goliath.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> For he called on the Most High Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">and he gave him strength in his right hand</span><br/>
<span class="indented">to kill a mighty warrior,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and to exalt the power of his people.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> So they glorified him for his tens of thousands,<br/>
<span class="indented">and praised him for the blessings of the Lord,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">in that a glorious crown was placed on his head.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> For he destroyed the enemies on every side,<br/>
<span class="indented">and brought to nothing the Philistines, his adversaries.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He broke their power to this day.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> In all his works, he gave thanks to the Holy One,<br/>
<span class="indented">the Most High, with words of glory.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He sang praise with his whole heart,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and loved him who made him.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> He set singers also before the altar,<br/>
<span class="indented">to make sweet melody by their voices.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> He gave beauty to the feasts,<br/>
<span class="indented">and set in order the seasons to perfection,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">while they praised his holy name,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and the sanctuary resounded from early morning.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> The Lord took away his sins,<br/>
<span class="indented">and exalted his horn forever.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He gave him a covenant of kings,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and a throne of glory in Israel.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> After him rose up a wise son,<br/>
<span class="indented">who lived in security because of him.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Solomon reigned in days of peace,<br/>
<span class="indented">and God gave him rest all around,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">that he might set up a house for his name,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and prepare a sanctuary forever.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> How wise you were in your youth,<br/>
<span class="indented">and filled as a river with instruction!</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Your soul covered the earth,<br/>
<span class="indented">and you filled it with parables and riddles.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Your name reached to the far islands,<br/>
<span class="indented">and you were beloved for your peace.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Countries marveled at you for your songs, proverbs, parables, and riddles.<br/>
<sup>18</sup> You were called by the glorious name,<br/>
<span class="indented">which was called upon Israel,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and you gathered gold like tin,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and multiplied silver like lead.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> But you laid your loins next to women,<br/>
<span class="indented">and you were brought into subjection in your body.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> You stained your honor,<br/>
<span class="indented">and profaned your seed,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">so that you brought wrath upon your children,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and they were grieved at your folly.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> So the kingdom was divided,<br/>
<span class="indented">and out of Ephraim came a disobedient kingdom.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> But the Lord will never forsake his mercy,<br/>
<span class="indented">and he will not destroy any of his works,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">nor blot out the offspring of his elect;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and he will not take away the seed of him who loves him.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">So he gave a remnant to Jacob,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and to David a root out of him.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Thus Solomon rested with his fathers,<br/>
<span class="indented">and left behind him one of his offspring,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">the foolishness of the people,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and one who lacked understanding, Rehoboam,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">who made the people revolt.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Also Jeroboam the son of Nebat,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">who caused Israel to sin,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and gave a way of sin to Ephraim.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> Their sins were multiplied exceedingly,<br/>
<span class="indented">to remove them from their land.</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> For they sought out every kind of wickedness,<br/>
<span class="indented">until vengeance came upon them.</span> </p></section>

<sup>6</sup> This knowledge is beyond me.<br/>
<span class="indented">It’s lofty. I can’t attain it.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Where could I go from your Spirit?<br/>
<span class="indented">Or where could I flee from your presence?</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> If I ascend up into heaven, you are there.<br/>
<span class="indented">If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, you are there!</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> If I take the wings of the dawn,<br/>
<span class="indented">and settle in the uttermost parts of the sea,</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> even there your hand will lead me,<br/>
<span class="indented">and your right hand will hold me.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> If I say, “Surely the darkness will overwhelm me.<br/>
<span class="indented">The light around me will be night,”</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> even the darkness doesn’t hide from you,<br/>
<span class="indented">but the night shines as the day.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">The darkness is like light to you.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> For you formed my inmost being.<br/>
<span class="indented">You knit me together in my mother’s womb.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> I will give thanks to you,<br/>
<span class="indented">for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Your works are wonderful.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">My soul knows that very well.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> My frame wasn’t hidden from you,<br/>
<span class="indented">when I was made in secret,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">woven together in the depths of the earth.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Your eyes saw my body.<br/>
<span class="indented">In your book they were all written,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">the days that were ordained for me,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">when as yet there were none of them.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> How precious to me are your thoughts, God!<br/>
<span class="indented">How vast is their sum!</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> If I would count them, they are more in number than the sand.<br/>
<span class="indented">When I wake up, I am still with you.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> If only you, God, would kill the wicked.<br/>
<span class="indented">Get away from me, you bloodthirsty men!</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> For they speak against you wickedly.<br/>
<span class="indented">Your enemies take your name in vain.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> Lord, don’t I hate those who hate you?<br/>
<span class="indented">Am I not grieved with those who rise up against you?</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> I hate them with perfect hatred.<br/>
<span class="indented">They have become my enemies.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Search me, God, and know my heart.<br/>
<span class="indented">Try me, and know my thoughts.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> See if there is any wicked way in me,<br/>
<span class="indented">and lead me in the everlasting way.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 140</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Deliver me, Lord, from the evil man.<br/>
<span class="indented">Preserve me from the violent man:</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> those who devise mischief in their hearts.<br/>
<span class="indented">They continually gather themselves together for war.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent.<br/>
<span class="indented">Viper’s poison is under their lips.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Lord, keep me from the hands of the wicked.<br/>
<span class="indented">Preserve me from the violent men who have determined to trip my feet.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> The proud have hidden a snare for me, they have spread the cords of a net by the path.<br/>
<span class="indented">They have set traps for me.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> I said to the Lord, “You are my God.”<br/>
<span class="indented">Listen to the cry of my petitions, Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Lord, the Lord, the strength of my salvation,<br/>
<span class="indented">you have covered my head in the day of battle.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Lord, don’t grant the desires of the wicked.<br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t let their evil plans succeed, or they will become proud.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> As for the head of those who surround me,<br/>
<span class="indented">let the mischief of their own lips cover them.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Let burning coals fall on them.<br/>
<span class="indented">Let them be thrown into the fire,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">into miry pits, from where they never rise.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> An evil speaker won’t be established in the earth.<br/>
<span class="indented">Evil will hunt the violent man to overthrow him.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> I know that the Lord will maintain the cause of the afflicted,<br/>
<span class="indented">and justice for the needy.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Surely the righteous will give thanks to your name.<br/>
<span class="indented">The upright will dwell in your presence.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 30:1–17 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 30:1–17</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, the revelation:<br/>
<span class="indented">The man says to Ithiel, to Ithiel and Ucal:</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> “Surely I am the most ignorant man,<br/>
<span class="indented">and don’t have a man’s understanding.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> I have not learned wisdom,<br/>
<span class="indented">neither do I have the knowledge of the Holy One.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Who has ascended up into heaven, and descended?<br/>
<span class="indented">Who has gathered the wind in his fists?</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Who has bound the waters in his garment?</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Who has established all the ends of the earth?</span><br/>
<span class="indented">What is his name, and what is his son’s name, if you know?</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> “Every word of God is flawless.<br/>
<span class="indented">He is a shield to those who take refuge in him.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Don’t you add to his words,<br/>

<span class="indented">Don’t deny me before I die.</span><br/>

<span class="indented">or lest I be poor, and steal,</span><br/>

<sup>10</sup> “Don’t slander a servant to his master,<br/>
<span class="indented">lest he curse you, and you be held guilty.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> There is a generation that curses their father,<br/>
<span class="indented">and doesn’t bless their mother.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> There is a generation that is pure in their own eyes,<br/>

<sup>13</sup> There is a generation, oh how lofty are their eyes!<br/>
<span class="indented">Their eyelids are lifted up.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> There is a generation whose teeth are like swords,<br/>
<span class="indented">and their jaws like knives,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">to devour the poor from the earth,</span><br/>

<sup>1</sup> Then the prophet Elijah arose like a fire.<br/>
<span class="indented">His word burned like a torch.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> He brought a famine on them.<br/>
<span class="indented">By his zeal, he made them few in number.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> By the word of the Lord, he shut up the sky.<br/>
<span class="indented">He also three times brought down fire.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> How was you glorified, Elijah,<br/>
<span class="indented">in your wondrous deeds!</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Who can glory like you?</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Who raised up a dead man from death,<br/>
<span class="indented">and from Sheol, by the word of the Most High;</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> who brought kings down to destruction,<br/>
<span class="indented">and honorable men from their bed;</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> who heard rebuke in Sinai,<br/>
<span class="indented">and judgments of vengeance in Horeb;</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> who anointed kings to take retribution,<br/>
<span class="indented">and prophets to succeed after him;</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> who was taken up in a storm of fire,<br/>
<span class="indented">and in a chariot of fiery horses;</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> who was recorded for reproofs in their times,<br/>
<span class="indented">to pacify wrath before it broke out into fury,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">to turn the heart of the father to the son,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and to restore the tribes of Jacob.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Blessed are those who saw you,<br/>
<span class="indented">and those who have been beautified with love;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for we also shall surely live.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Elijah it was, who was wrapped in a whirlwind;<br/>
<span class="indented">but Elisha was filled with his spirit.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">In all his days he didn’t tremble before any ruler,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and no one brought him into subjection.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Nothing was too high for him.<br/>
<span class="indented">When he was buried, his body prophesied.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> In his life, he did wonders;<br/>
<span class="indented">and in death, he accomplished marvelous deeds.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> For all this, the people didn’t repent,<br/>
<span class="indented">and they didn’t depart from their sins,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">until they were carried away as plunder from their land,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and were scattered through all the earth.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Yet there remained a small people,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and a ruler in the house of David.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Some of them did what was right,<br/>
<span class="indented">but some sinned more and more.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Hezekiah fortified his city,<br/>
<span class="indented">and brought water into the middle of it.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He dug through rock with iron,</span><br/>

<span class="indented">and sent Rabshakeh.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He lifted up his hand against Zion,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and boasted grievously in his arrogance.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> Then their hearts and hands trembled,<br/>
<span class="indented">and they were in pain, like women in labor.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> But they called upon the Lord who is merciful,<br/>
<span class="indented">spreading out their hands to him;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and the Holy One quickly heard them from heaven,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and delivered them by the hand of Isaiah.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> He struck the army of the Assyrians,<br/>
<span class="indented">and his angel destroyed them.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> For Hezekiah did what was pleasing to the Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">and was strong in the ways of David his father,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">which Isaiah the prophet, who was great and faithful in his vision, commanded him.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> In his days, the sun went backward;<br/>
<span class="indented">and he added life to the king.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> He saw by an excellent spirit what should come to pass at last,<br/>
<span class="indented">and comforted those who mourned in Zion.</span><br/>

<!-- Psalms 141, 142, 143 -->
<h3>Psalms</h3>
<h4>Psalm 141</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Lord, I have called on you.<br/>
<span class="indented">Come to me quickly!</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Listen to my voice when I call to you.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Let my prayer be set before you like incense;<br/>
<span class="indented">the lifting up of my hands like the evening sacrifice.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Set a watch, Lord, before my mouth.<br/>
<span class="indented">Keep the door of my lips.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Don’t incline my heart to any evil thing,<br/>
<span class="indented">to practice deeds of wickedness with men who work iniquity.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t let me eat of their delicacies.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Let the righteous strike me, it is kindness;<br/>
<span class="indented">let him reprove me, it is like oil on the head.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t let my head refuse it;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">yet my prayer is always against evil deeds.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock.<br/>
<span class="indented">They will hear my words, for they are well spoken.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> “As when one plows and breaks up the earth,<br/>
<span class="indented">our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol.”</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> For my eyes are on you, Lord, the Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">In you, I take refuge. Don’t leave my soul destitute.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me,<br/>
<span class="indented">from the traps of the workers of iniquity.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Let the wicked fall together into their own nets,<br/>
<span class="indented">while I pass by.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 142</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> I cry with my voice to the Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">With my voice, I ask the Lord for mercy.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> I pour out my complaint before him.<br/>
<span class="indented">I tell him my troubles.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> When my spirit was overwhelmed within me,<br/>
<span class="indented">you knew my route.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">On the path in which I walk, they have hidden a snare for me.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Look on my right, and see;<br/>
<span class="indented">for there is no one who is concerned for me.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Refuge has fled from me.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">No one cares for my soul.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> I cried to you, Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">I said, “You are my refuge,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">my portion in the land of the living.”</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Listen to my cry, for I am in desperate need.<br/>
<span class="indented">Deliver me from my persecutors,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for they are stronger than me.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Bring my soul out of prison,<br/>
<span class="indented">that I may give thanks to your name.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">The righteous will surround me,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for you will be good to me.</span> </p> <h4>Psalm 143</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Hear my prayer, Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">Listen to my petitions.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">In your faithfulness and righteousness, relieve me.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> Don’t enter into judgment with your servant,<br/>
<span class="indented">for in your sight no man living is righteous.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> For the enemy pursues my soul.<br/>
<span class="indented">He has struck my life down to the ground.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He has made me live in dark places,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">as those who have been long dead.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Therefore my spirit is overwhelmed within me.<br/>
<span class="indented">My heart within me is desolate.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> I remember the days of old.<br/>
<span class="indented">I meditate on all your doings.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I contemplate the work of your hands.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> I spread out my hands to you.<br/>
<span class="indented">My soul thirsts for you, like a parched land.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Selah.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Hurry to answer me, Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">My spirit fails.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Don’t hide your face from me,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">so that I don’t become like those who go down into the pit.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Cause me to hear your loving kindness in the morning,<br/>
<span class="indented">for I trust in you.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Cause me to know the way in which I should walk,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for I lift up my soul to you.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Deliver me, Lord, from my enemies.<br/>
<span class="indented">I flee to you to hide me.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> Teach me to do your will,<br/>
<span class="indented">for you are my God.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Your Spirit is good.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Lead me in the land of uprightness.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Revive me, Lord, for your name’s sake.<br/>
<span class="indented">In your righteousness, bring my soul out of trouble.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> In your loving kindness, cut off my enemies,<br/>
<span class="indented">and destroy all those who afflict my soul,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for I am your servant.</span> </p> <!-- Proverbs 30:18–33 -->
<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 30:18–33</h4>
<p>
<sup>18</sup> “There are three things which are too amazing for me,<br/>
<span class="indented">four which I don’t understand:</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> The way of an eagle in the air,<br/>
<span class="indented">the way of a serpent on a rock,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">the way of a ship in the midst of the sea,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and the way of a man with a maiden.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> So is the way of an adulterous woman:<br/>
<span class="indented">She eats and wipes her mouth,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and says, ‘I have done nothing wrong.’</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> “For three things the earth trembles,<br/>
<span class="indented">and under four, it can’t bear up:</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> for a servant when he is king,<br/>
<span class="indented">a fool when he is filled with food,</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> for an unloved woman when she is married,<br/>
<span class="indented">and a servant who is heir to her mistress.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> “There are four things which are little on the earth,<br/>
<span class="indented">but they are exceedingly wise:</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> the ants are not a strong people,<br/>
<span class="indented">yet they provide their food in the summer;</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> the conies are but a feeble folk,<br/>
<span class="indented">yet they make their houses in the rocks;</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> the locusts have no king,<br/>
<span class="indented">yet they advance in ranks;</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> you can catch a lizard with your hands,<br/>
<span class="indented">yet it is in kings’ palaces.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> “There are three things which are stately in their march,<br/>
<span class="indented">four which are stately in going:</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> The lion, which is mightiest among animals,<br/>
<span class="indented">and doesn’t turn away for any;</span><br/>
<sup>31</sup> the greyhound;<br/>
<span class="indented">the male goat;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and the king against whom there is no rising up.</span><br/>
<sup>32</sup> “If you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself,<br/>
<span class="indented">or if you have thought evil,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">put your hand over your mouth.</span><br/>
<sup>33</sup> For as the churning of milk produces butter,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the wringing of the nose produces blood;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">so the stirring up of anger produces strife.”</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 49 -->
<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 49</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> The memory of Josiah is like the composition of incense<br/>
<span class="indented">prepared by the art of the perfumer.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">It is sweet as honey in every mouth,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and as music at a banquet of wine.</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> He behaved himself uprightly in the conversion of the people,<br/>
<span class="indented">and took away the abominations of iniquity.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> He set his heart right toward the Lord.<br/>
<span class="indented">In the time of wicked men, he strengthened godliness.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Except David, Hezekiah, and Josiah,<br/>
<span class="indented">all committed trespass;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for the kings of Judah abandoned the law of the Most High.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">They despised the fear of God.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> They gave their power to others,<br/>
<span class="indented">and their glory to a foreign nation.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> They set the chosen city of the sanctuary on fire,<br/>
<span class="indented">and made her streets desolate,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">as Jeremiah had said.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> They mistreated him;<br/>
<span class="indented">yet he was sanctified in his mother’s womb as a prophet,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">to root out, and to afflict, and to destroy;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and to build and to plant.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Ezekiel saw the vision of glory,<br/>
<span class="indented">which God showed him on the chariot of the cherubim.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> For he made mention of the enemies under the figure of rain,<br/>
<span class="indented">doing good to those who showed right ways.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> May the bones of the twelve prophets flourish out of their place.<br/>
<span class="indented">They comforted Jacob,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and delivered them with confident hope.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> How shall we magnify Zerubbabel?<br/>
<span class="indented">He was as a signet on the right hand.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> So was Jeshua the son of Jozadak.<br/>
<span class="indented">In their days, they built the house,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and raised a holy temple to the Lord,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">prepared for everlasting glory.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> Nehemiah’s memorial is great.<br/>
<span class="indented">He raised up for us the walls that had fallen down.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He set up the gates and bars,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and rebuilt our houses again.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> No one was created upon the earth like Enoch;<br/>
<span class="indented">for he was taken up from the earth.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> Neither was there a man like Joseph,<br/>
<span class="indented">a leader of his brothers,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">a supporter of the people;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and his bones were visited.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Shem and Seth were honored among men,<br/>
<span class="indented">and Adam above every living thing in creation.</span> </p></section>

<p>
<sup>1</sup> Blessed be the Lord, my rock,<br/>
<span class="indented">who teaches my hands to war,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and my fingers to battle:</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> my loving kindness, my fortress,<br/>
<span class="indented">my high tower, my deliverer,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">my shield, and he in whom I take refuge,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">who subdues my people under me.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Lord, what is man, that you care for him?<br/>
<span class="indented">Or the son of man, that you think of him?</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> Man is like a breath.<br/>
<span class="indented">His days are like a shadow that passes away.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> Part your heavens, Lord, and come down.<br/>
<span class="indented">Touch the mountains, and they will smoke.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Throw out lightning, and scatter them.<br/>
<span class="indented">Send out your arrows, and rout them.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Stretch out your hand from above,<br/>
<span class="indented">rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">out of the hands of foreigners,</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> whose mouths speak deceit,<br/>

<sup>9</sup> I will sing a new song to you, God.<br/>
<span class="indented">On a ten-stringed lyre, I will sing praises to you.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> You are he who gives salvation to kings,<br/>
<span class="indented">who rescues David, his servant, from the deadly sword.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hands of foreigners,<br/>
<span class="indented">whose mouths speak deceit,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> Then our sons will be like well-nurtured plants in their youth.<br/>

<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 31:1–9</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> The words of King Lemuel—the revelation which his mother taught him:<br/>
<sup>2</sup> “Oh, my son! Oh, son of my womb!<br/>
<span class="indented">Oh, son of my vows!</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> Don’t give your strength to women,<br/>
<span class="indented">nor your ways to that which destroys kings.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> It is not for kings, Lemuel,<br/>
<span class="indented">it is not for kings to drink wine;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">nor for princes to say, ‘Where is strong drink?’</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> lest they drink, and forget the law,<br/>
<span class="indented">and pervert the justice due to anyone who is afflicted.</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> Give strong drink to him who is ready to perish,<br/>
<span class="indented">and wine to the bitter in soul.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> Let him drink, and forget his poverty,<br/>
<span class="indented">and remember his misery no more.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Open your mouth for the mute,<br/>
<span class="indented">in the cause of all who are left desolate.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> Open your mouth, judge righteously,<br/>
<span class="indented">and serve justice to the poor and needy.”</span> </p> <!-- Sirach 50 -->

<h4>Sirach 50</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Simon the high priest, the son of Onias,<br/>
<span class="indented">who in his life repaired the house again,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and in his days fortified the temple;</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> and by him was built the high double wall,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the enclosure of the temple;</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> by him the height was founded, the reservoir like a sea<br/>
<span class="indented">in circumference.</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> He cared for his people not to fall,<br/>
<span class="indented">and fortified the city against siege.</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> How glorious was he when the people gathered around him<br/>
<span class="indented">at his coming out of the sanctuary!</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> He was as the morning star among clouds,<br/>
<span class="indented">and as the full moon at the feast season;</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> as the sun shining upon the temple of the Most High,<br/>
<span class="indented">and as the rainbow giving light in the bright clouds;</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> as the flower of roses in the spring of the year,<br/>
<span class="indented">as lilies by the rivers of waters,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">as the branches of frankincense in the time of summer;</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> as fire and incense in the censer;<br/>
<span class="indented">as a vessel all of beaten gold,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">adorned with all kinds of precious stones;</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> as an olive tree budding forth fruits,<br/>
<span class="indented">and as a cypress growing high among the clouds.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> When he took up his robe of glory<br/>
<span class="indented">and put on the perfection of excellency,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and went up to the holy altar,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">he made the court of the sanctuary glorious.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> And when he received the parts out of the priests’ hands,<br/>
<span class="indented">he himself also stood by the hearth of the altar,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">compassed with his brothers round about,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">as a young cedar in Lebanon;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and they compassed him about as palm trunks.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> All the sons of Aaron in their glory,<br/>
<span class="indented">with the Lord’s offering in their hands,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">before all the congregation of Israel;</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> and finishing the service at the altars,<br/>
<span class="indented">that he might adorn the offering of the Most High, the Almighty;</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> he stretched out his hand to the cup,<br/>
<span class="indented">and poured out of the blood of the grape.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">He poured out at the foot of the altar</span><br/>
<span class="indented">a sweet-smelling fragrance to the Most High, the King of all.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> Then the sons of Aaron shouted,<br/>
<span class="indented">and sounded the trumpets of beaten work;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">they made a great noise to be heard,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">for a remembrance before the Most High.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> Then all the people together hurried,<br/>
<span class="indented">and fell down on their faces to the earth,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">to worship their Lord, the Almighty, the Most High.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> The singers also praised him with their voices;<br/>
<span class="indented">in the entire house was made sweet music.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> The people implored the Lord Most High,<br/>
<span class="indented">in prayer before him who is merciful,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">until the worship of the Lord was ended;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and so they accomplished his service.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> Then he went down, and lifted up his hands<br/>
<span class="indented">over the entire congregation of the children of Israel,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">to give the blessing of the Lord with his lips,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and to rejoice in his name.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> They bowed themselves down to worship a second time,<br/>
<span class="indented">that they might receive a blessing from the Most High.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> Now therefore bless the God of all,<br/>
<span class="indented">who does great things everywhere;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">who exalts our days from the womb,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and deals with us according to his mercy.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> May he grant us joyfulness of heart,<br/>
<span class="indented">and that peace may be in our days in Israel forever;</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> that he would confirm his mercy with us,<br/>
<span class="indented">and deliver us in his time!</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> There are two nations that my soul detests,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the third is no nation at all:</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> those who live in Mount Seir, and the Philistines,<br/>
<span class="indented">and the foolish people who live in Shechem.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> Jesus the son of Sirach of Jerusalem has written in this book<br/>
<span class="indented">the instruction of understanding and knowledge,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">who poured out wisdom from his heart.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> Blessed is he who will be occupied in these things;<br/>
<span class="indented">he who lays them up in his heart will become wise.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> For if he does them, he will be strong for all things;<br/>

<h3>Proverbs</h3>
<h4>Proverbs 31:10–31</h4>
<p>
<sup>10</sup> Who can find a worthy woman?<br/>
<span class="indented">For her price is far above rubies.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> The heart of her husband trusts in her.<br/>
<span class="indented">He shall have no lack of gain.</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> She does him good, and not harm,<br/>
<span class="indented">all the days of her life.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> She seeks wool and flax,<br/>
<span class="indented">and works eagerly with her hands.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> She is like the merchant ships.<br/>
<span class="indented">She brings her bread from afar.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> She rises also while it is yet night,<br/>
<span class="indented">gives food to her household,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and portions for her servant girls.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> She considers a field, and buys it.<br/>
<span class="indented">With the fruit of her hands, she plants a vineyard.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> She arms her waist with strength,<br/>
<span class="indented">and makes her arms strong.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> She perceives that her merchandise is profitable.<br/>
<span class="indented">Her lamp doesn’t go out by night.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> She lays her hands to the distaff,<br/>
<span class="indented">and her hands hold the spindle.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> She opens her arms to the poor;<br/>
<span class="indented">yes, she extends her hands to the needy.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> She is not afraid of the snow for her household,<br/>
<span class="indented">for all her household are clothed with scarlet.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> She makes for herself carpets of tapestry.<br/>
<span class="indented">Her clothing is fine linen and purple.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Her husband is respected in the gates,<br/>
<span class="indented">when he sits among the elders of the land.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> She makes linen garments and sells them,<br/>
<span class="indented">and delivers sashes to the merchant.</span><br/>

<span class="indented">She laughs at the time to come.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> She opens her mouth with wisdom.<br/>
<span class="indented">Kind instruction is on her tongue.</span><br/>

<h3>Sirach</h3>
<h4>Sirach 51</h4>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> I will give thanks to you, O Lord and King,<br/>
<span class="indented">and will praise you, O God my Savior.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I do give thanks to your name;</span><br/>
<sup>2</sup> for you were my protector and helper,<br/>
<span class="indented">and delivered my body from destruction,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and from the snare of a slanderous tongue,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">from lips that create lies;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and before those who stood by,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">you were my helper.</span><br/>
<sup>3</sup> And you delivered me,<br/>
<span class="indented">according to the multitude of the mercy of your name,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">from the roaring of those who were ready to devour me,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">out of the hands of those who sought my life,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">from the many afflictions which I had;</span><br/>
<sup>4</sup> from the choking of a fire on every side,<br/>
<span class="indented">and out of the midst of the fire which I didn’t kindle;</span><br/>
<sup>5</sup> out of the deep belly of the grave;<br/>
<span class="indented">from an unclean tongue, and lying words—</span><br/>
<sup>6</sup> the slander of an unrighteous tongue came against me;<br/>
<span class="indented">my soul drew near even to death,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">my life was near to the grave beneath.</span><br/>
<sup>7</sup> They surrounded me on every side,<br/>
<span class="indented">and there was no one to help me.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I looked for help from men,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and there was none.</span><br/>
<sup>8</sup> Then I remembered your mercy, O Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">and your work which has been of old,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">how you deliver those who wait for you,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and save them out of the hand of the enemies.</span><br/>
<sup>9</sup> I lifted up my prayer from the earth,<br/>
<span class="indented">and prayed for deliverance from death.</span><br/>
<sup>10</sup> I called upon the Lord, the Father of my Lord,<br/>
<span class="indented">that he would not forsake me in the days of affliction,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">in the time when there was no help against the proud.</span><br/>
<sup>11</sup> I will praise your name continually,<br/>
<span class="indented">and will sing praise with thanksgiving;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">my prayer was heard,</span><br/>
<sup>12</sup> for you saved me from destruction,<br/>
<span class="indented">and delivered me from the evil time.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Therefore I will give thanks and praise you,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and bless the name of the Lord.</span><br/>
<sup>13</sup> When I was yet young, before I went abroad,<br/>
<span class="indented">I sought wisdom openly in my prayer.</span><br/>
<sup>14</sup> Before the temple I asked for her.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will search for her to the last.</span><br/>
<sup>15</sup> From her blossoming to the ripening of her grape,<br/>
<span class="indented">my heart has delighted in her.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">My foot walked in the plain way;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">from my youth I have known your teaching.</span><br/>
<sup>16</sup> I inclined my ear a little, and received her,<br/>
<span class="indented">and found for myself much instruction.</span><br/>
<sup>17</sup> I profited in it.<br/>
<span class="indented">I will give glory to him who gives me wisdom.</span><br/>
<sup>18</sup> For I determined to practice her,<br/>
<span class="indented">I was zealous for that which is good;</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and I will never be put to shame.</span><br/>
<sup>19</sup> My soul has wrestled in her,<br/>
<span class="indented">and I was diligent to do her work.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I stretched out my hands to the heights,</span><br/>
<span class="indented">and bewailed my ignorance of her.</span><br/>
<sup>20</sup> I directed my soul to her,<br/>
<span class="indented">and in pureness I found her.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">I got understanding with her from the first.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">Therefore I will not be forsaken.</span><br/>
<sup>21</sup> My heart was stirred to seek her;<br/>
<span class="indented">therefore I have gained a good possession.</span><br/>
<sup>22</sup> The Lord gave me a tongue for my reward;<br/>
<span class="indented">and I will praise him therewith.</span><br/>
<sup>23</sup> Draw near to me, you unlearned,<br/>
<span class="indented">and lodge in the house of instruction.</span><br/>
<sup>24</sup> Say, “Why are you lacking in these things,<br/>
<span class="indented">and your souls are very thirsty?”</span><br/>
<sup>25</sup> I opened my mouth, and spoke,<br/>
<span class="indented">“Buy her for yourselves without money.</span><br/>
<sup>26</sup> Put your neck under the yoke,<br/>
<span class="indented">and let your soul receive instruction.</span><br/>
<span class="indented">She is near that you may find her.</span><br/>
<sup>27</sup> Behold with your eyes how that I have labored a little,<br/>
<span class="indented">and have found for myself much rest.</span><br/>
<sup>28</sup> Get instruction with a great sum of silver,<br/>
<span class="indented">and gain much gold by her.</span><br/>
<sup>29</sup> May your soul rejoice in his mercy,<br/>
<span class="indented">and may you not be put to shame when you praise him.</span><br/>
<sup>30</sup> Work your work before the time comes,<br/>
<span class="indented">and in his time he will give you your reward.”</span> </p></section>
